ANSWER SHEET points Text The longest bull run in a century of art market history ended on a dramatic note with a sale of works by Damien Hirst Beautiful Inside My Head Forever at Sotheby s in London on September th All but two pieces sold fetching more than m a record for a sale by a single artist It was a last victory As the auctioneer called out bids in New York one of the oldest banks on Wall Street Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy The world art market had already been losing momentum for a while after rising bewilderingly since At its peak in it was worth some billion reckons Clare McAndrew founder of Arts Economics a research firm double the figure five years earlier Since then it may have come down to billion But the market generates interest far beyond its size because it brings together great wealth enormous egos greed passion and controversy in a way matched by few other industries In the weeks and months that followed Mr Hirst s sale spending of any sort became deeply unfashionable especially in New York where the bail out of the banks coincided with the loss of thousands of jobs and the financial demise of many art buying investors In the art world that meant collectors stayed away from galleries and salerooms Sales of contemporary art fell by two thirds and in the most overheated sector they were down by nearly in the year to November Within weeks the world s two biggest auction houses Sotheby s and Christie s had to pay out nearly m in guarantees to clients who had placed works for sale with them The current downturn in the art market is the worst since the Japanese stopped buying Impressionists at the end of This time experts reckon that prices are about down on their peak on average though some have been far more fluctuant But Edward Dolman Christie s chief executive says I m pretty confident we re at the bottom What makes this slump different from the last he says is that there are still buyers in the market Almost everyone who was interviewed for this special report said that the biggest problem at the moment is not a lack of demand but a lack of good work to sell The three Ds death debt and divorce still deliver works of art to the market But anyone who does not have to sell is keeping away waiting for confidence to return In the first paragraph Damien Hirst s sale was referred to as a last victory because A the art market had witnessed a succession of victories B the auctioneer finally got the two pieces at the highest bids C Beautiful Inside My Head Forever won over all masterpieces D it was successfully made just before the world financial crisis By saying spending of any sort became deeply unfashionable Line Para the author suggests that A collectors were no longer actively involved in art market auctions B people stopped every kind of spending and stayed away from galleries C art collection as a fashion had lost its appeal to a great extent D works of art in general had gone out of fashion so they were not worth buying Which of the following statements is NOT true A Sales of contemporary art fell dramatically from to B The art market surpassed many other industries in momentum C The art market generally went downward in various ways D Some art dealers were awaiting better chances to come The three Ds mentioned in the last paragraph are A auction houses favorites B contemporary trends C factors promoting artwork circulation D styles representing impressionists The most appropriate title for this text could be A Fluctuation of Art Prices B Up to date Art Auctions C Art Market in Decline D Shifted Interest in Arts Text I was addressing a small gathering in a suburban Virginia living room a women s group that had invited men to join them Throughout the evening one man had been particularly talkative frequently offering ideas and anecdotes while his wife sat silently beside him on the couch Toward the end of the evening I commented that women frequently complain that their husbands don t talk to them This man quickly nodded in agreement He gestured toward his wife and said She s the talker in our family The room burst into laughter the man looked puzzled and hurt It s true he explained When I come home from work I have nothing to say If she didn t keep the conversation going we d spend the whole evening in silence This episode crystallizes the irony that although American men tend to talk more than women in public situations they often talk less at home And this pattern is wreaking havoc with marriage The pattern was observed by political scientist Andrew Hacker in the late s Sociologist Catherine Kohler Riessman reports in her new book Divorce Talk that most of the women she interviewed but only a few of the men gave lack of communication as the reason for their divorces Given the current divorce rate of nearly percent that amounts to millions of cases in the United States every year a virtual epidemic of failed conversation In my own research complaints from women about their husbands most often focused not on tangible inequities such as having given up the chance for a career to accompany a husband to his or doing far more than their share of daily life support work like cleaning cooking and social arrangements Instead they focused on communication He doesn t listen to me He doesn t talk to me I found as Hacker observed years before that most wives want their husbands to be first and foremost conversational partners but few husbands share this expectation of their wives In short the image that best represents the current crisis is the stereotypical cartoon scene of a man sitting at the breakfast table with a newspaper held up in front of his face while a woman glares at the back of it wanting to talk What is most wives main expectation of their husbands A Talking to them B Trusting them C Supporting their careers D Sharing housework Judging from the context the phrase wreaking havoc Line Para most probably means A generating motivation B exerting influence C causing damage D creating pressure All of the following are true EXCEPT A men tend to talk more in public than women B nearly percent of recent divorces are caused by failed conversation C women attach much importance to communication between couples D a female tends to be more talkative at home than her spouse Which of the following can best summarize the main idea of this text A The moral decaying deserves more research by sociologists B Marriage break up stems from sex inequalities C Husband and wife have different expectations from their marriage D Conversational patterns between man and wife are different In the following part immediately after this text the author will most probably focus on A a vivid account of the new book Divorce Talk B a detailed description of the stereotypical cartoon C other possible reasons for a high divorce rate in the U S D a brief introduction to the political scientist Andrew Hacker Text Over the past decade many companies had perfected the art of creating automatic behavior habits among consumers These habits have helped companies earn billions of dollars when customers eat snacks or wipe counters almost without thinking often in response to a carefully designed set of daily cues There are fundamental public health problems like dirty hands instead of a soap habit that remain killers only because we can t figure out how to change people s habits Dr Curtis said the director of the Hygiene Center at the London School of Hygiene Tropical Medicine We wanted to learn from private industry how to create new behaviors that happens automatically The companies that Dr Curtis turned to Procter Gamble Colgate Palmolive and Unilever had invested hundreds of millions of dollars finding the subtle cues in consumers lives that corporations could use to introduce new routines If you look hard enough you ll find that many of the products we use every day chewing gums skin moisturizers disinfecting wipes air fresheners water purifiers health snacks antiperspirants colognes teeth whiteners fabric softeners vitamins are results of manufactured habits A century ago few people regularly brushed their teeth multiple times a day Today because of shrewd advertising and public health campaigns many Americans habitually give their pearly whites a cavity preventing scrub twice a day often with Colgate Crest or one of the other brands A few decades ago many people didn t drink water outside of a meal Then beverage companies started bottling the production of far off springs and now office workers unthinkingly sip bottled water all day long Chewing gum once bought primarily by adolescent boys is now featured in commercials as a breath freshener and teeth cleanser for use after a meal Skin moisturizers are advertised as part of morning beauty rituals slipped in between hair brushing and putting on makeup Our products succeed when they become part of daily or weekly patterns said Carol Berning a consumer psychologist who recently retired from Procter Gamble the company that sold billion of Tide Crest and other products last year Creating positive habits is a huge part of improving our consumers lives and it s essential to make new products commercially viable Through experiments and observation social scientists like Dr Berning have learned that there is power in tying certain behaviors to habitual cues through ruthless advertising As this new science of habit has emerged controversies have erupted when the tactics have been used to sell questionable beauty creams or unhealthy foods According to Dr Curtis habits like hand washing with soap A should be further cultivated B should be changed gradually C are deeply rooted in history D are basically private concerns Bottled water chewing gum and skin moisturizers are mentioned in Paragraph so as to A reveal their impact on people s habits B show the urgent need of daily necessities C indicate their effect on people s buying power D manifest the significant role of good habits Which of the following does NOT belong to products that help create people s habits A Tide B Crest C Colgate D Unilever From the text we know that some of consumer s habits are developed due to A perfected art of products B automatic behavior creation C commercial promotions D scientific experiments The author s attitude toward the influence of advertisement on people s habits is A indifferent B negative C positive D biased Text Many Americans regard the jury system as a concrete expression of crucial democratic values including the principles that all citizens who meet minimal qualifications of age and literacy are equally competent to serve on juries that jurors should be selected randomly from a representative cross section of the community that no citizen should be denied the right to serve on a jury on account of race religion sex or national origin that defendants are entitled to trial by their peers and that verdicts should represent the conscience of the community and not just the letter of the law The jury is also said to be the best surviving example of direct rather than representative democracy In a direct democracy citizens take turns governing themselves rather than electing representatives to govern for them But as recently as in jury selection procedures conflicted with these democratic ideals In some states for example jury duty was limited to persons of supposedly superior intelligence education and moral character Although the Supreme Court of the United States had prohibited intentional racial discrimination in jury selection as early as the case of Strauder v West Virginia the practice of selecting so called elite or blue ribbon juries provided a convenient way around this and other antidiscrimination laws The system also failed to regularly include women on juries until the mid th century Although women first served on state juries in Utah in it was not until the s that a majority of states made women eligible for jury duty Even then several states automatically exempted women from jury duty unless they personally asked to have their names included on the jury list This practice was justified by the claim that women were needed at home and it kept juries unrepresentative of women through the s In the Congress of the United States passed the Jury Selection and Service Act ushering in a new era of democratic reforms for the jury This law abolished special educational requirements for federal jurors and required them to be selected at random from a cross section of the entire community In the landmark decision Taylor vs Louisiana the Supreme Court extended the requirement that juries be representative of all parts of the community to the state level The Taylor decision also declared sex discrimination in jury selection to be unconstitutional and ordered states to use the same procedures for selecting male and female jurors From the principles of the US jury system we learn that A both literate and illiterate people can serve on juries B defendants are immune from trial by their peers C no age limit should be imposed for jury service D judgment should consider the opinion of the public The practice of selecting so called elite jurors prior to showed A the inadequacy of antidiscrimination laws B the prevalent discrimination against certain races C the conflicting ideals in jury selection procedures D the arrogance common among the Supreme Court justices Even in the s women were seldom on the jury list in some states because A they were automatically banned by state laws B they fell far short of the required qualifications C they were supposed to perform domestic duties D they tended to evade public engagement After the Jury Selection and Service Act was passed A sex discrimination in jury selection was unconstitutional and had to be abolished B educational requirements became less rigid in the selection of federal jurors C jurors at the state level ought to be representative of the entire community D states ought to conform to the federal court in reforming the jury system In discussing the US jury system the text centers on A its nature and problems B its characteristics and tradition C its problems and their solutions D its tradition and development Section III

world that seems increasingly Last month Howard Schmidt the nation s cyber czar offered the federal government a to make the Web a safer place a voluntary trusted identity system that would be the high tech of a physical key a fingerprint and a photo ID card all rolled one The system might use a smart identity card or a digital credential to a specific computer and would authenticate users at a range of online services The idea is to a federation of private online identity systems User could which system to join and only registered users whose identities have been authenticated could navigate those systems The approach contrasts with one that would require an Internet driver s license by the government Google and Microsoft are among companies that already have these single sign on systems that make it possible for users to just once but use many different services the approach would create a walled garden in cyberspace with safe neighborhoods and bright streetlights to establish a sense of a community Mr Schmidt described it as a voluntary ecosystem in which individuals and organizations can complete online transactions with trusting the identities of each other and the identities of the infrastructure which the transaction runs Still the administration s plan has privacy rights activists Some applaud the approach others are concerned It seems clear that such a scheme is an initiative push toward what would be a compulsory Internet driver s license mentality The plan has also been greeted with by some computer security experts who worry that the voluntary

University For the rest of the decade she apparently managed both roles without attracting much criticism But by the end of Ms Simmons was under fire for having sat on Goldman s compensation committee how could she have let those enormous bonus payouts pass unremarked By February the next year Ms Simmons had left the board The position was just taking up too much time she said Outside directors are supposed to serve as helpful yet less biased advisers on a firm s board Having made their wealth and their reputations elsewhere they presumably have enough independence to disagree with the chief executive s proposals If the sky and the share price is falling outside directors should be able to give advice based on having weathered their own crises The researchers from Ohio University used a database that covered more than firms and more than different directors between and Then they simply checked which directors stayed from one proxy statement to the next The most likely reason for departing a board was age so the researchers concentrated on those surprise disappearances by directors under the age of They found that after a surprise departure the probability that the company will subsequently have to restate earnings increased by nearly The likelihood of being named in a federal class action lawsuit also increases and the stock is likely to perform worse The effect tended to be larger for larger firms Although a correlation between them leaving and subsequent bad performance at the firm is suggestive it does not mean that such directors are always jumping off a sinking ship Often they trade up leaving riskier smaller firms for larger and more stable firms But the researchers believe that outside directors have an easier time of avoiding a blow to their reputations if they leave a firm before bad news breaks even if a review of history shows they were on the board at the time any wrongdoing occurred Firms who want to keep their outside directors through tough times may have to create incentives Otherwise outside directors will follow the example of Ms Simmons once again very popular on campus According to Paragraph Ms Simmons was criticized for A gaining excessive profits B failing to fulfill her duty C refusing to make compromises D leaving the board in tough times We learn from Paragraph that outside directors are supposed to be A generous investors B unbiased executives C share price forecasters D independent advisers According to the researchers from Ohio University after an outside director s surprise departure the firm is likely to A become more stable B report increased earnings C do less well in the stock market D perform worse in lawsuits It can be inferred from the last paragraph that outside directors A may stay for the attractive offers from the firm B have often had records of wrongdoings in the firm C are accustomed to stress free work in the firm D will decline incentives from the firm The author s attitude toward the role of outside directors is A permissive B positive C scornful D critical Text Whatever happened to the death of newspaper A year ago the end seemed near The recession threatened to remove the advertising and readers that had not already fled to the Internet Newspapers like the San Francisco Chronicle were chronicling their own doom America s Federal Trade commission launched a round of talks about how to save newspapers Should they become charitable corporations Should the state subsidize them It will hold another meeting soon But the discussions now seem out of date In much of the world there is little sign of crisis German and Brazilian papers have shrugged off the recession Even American newspapers which inhabit the most troubled corner of the global industry have not only survived but often returned to profit Not the profit margins that were routine a few years ago but profit all the same It has not been much fun Many papers stayed afloat by pushing journalists overboard The American Society of News Editors reckons that newsroom jobs have gone since Readers are paying more for slimmer products Some papers even had the nerve to refuse delivery to distant suburbs Yet these desperate measures have proved the right ones and sadly for many journalists they can be pushed further Newspapers are becoming more balanced businesses with a healthier mix of revenues from readers and advertisers American papers have long been highly unusual in their reliance on ads Fully of their revenues came from advertising in according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation Development OECD In Japan the proportion is Not surprisingly Japanese newspapers are much more stable The whirlwind that swept through newsrooms harmed everybody but much of the damage has been concentrated in areas where newspapers are least distinctive Car and film reviewers have gone So have science and general business reporters Foreign bureaus have been savagely cut off Newspapers are less complete as a result But completeness is no longer a virtue in the newspaper business By saying Newspapers like their own doom Lines Para the author indicates that newspapers A neglected the sign of crisis B failed to get state subsidies C were not charitable corporations D were in a desperate situation Some newspapers refused delivery to distant suburbs probably because A readers threatened to pay less B newspapers wanted to reduce costs C journalists reported little about these areas D subscribers complained about slimmer products Compared with their American counterparts Japanese newspapers are much more stable because they A have more sources of revenue B have more balanced newsrooms C are less dependent on advertising D are less affected by readership What can be inferred from the last paragraph about the current newspaper business A Distinctiveness is an essential feature of newspapers B Completeness is to blame for the failure of newspaper C Foreign bureaus play a crucial role in the newspaper business D Readers have lost their interest in car and film reviews The most appropriate title for this text would be A American Newspapers Struggling for Survival B American Newspapers Gone with the Wind C American Newspapers A Thriving Business D American Newspapers A Hopeless Story Text We tend to think of the decades immediately following World War II as a time of prosperity and growth with soldiers returning home by the millions going off to college on the G I Bill and lining up at the marriage bureaus But when it came to their houses it was a time of common sense and a belief that less could truly be more During the Depression and the war Americans had learned to live with less and that restraint in combination with the postwar confidence in the future made small efficient housing positively stylish Economic condition was only a stimulus for the trend toward efficient living The phrase less is more was actually first popularized by a German the architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe who like other people associated with the Bauhaus a school of design emigrated to the United States before World War II and took up posts at American architecture schools These designers came to exert enormous influence on the course of American architecture but none more so than Mies Mies s signature phrase means that less decoration properly organized has more impact than a lot Elegance he believed did not derive from abundance Like other modern architects he employed metal glass and laminated wood materials that we take for granted today but that in the s symbolized the future Mies s sophisticated presentation masked the fact that the spaces he designed were small and efficient rather than big and often empty The apartments in the elegant towers Mies built on Chicago s Lake Shore Drive for example were smaller two bedroom units under square feet than those in their older neighbors along the city s Gold Coast But they were popular because of their airy glass walls the views they afforded and the elegance of the buildings details and proportions the architectural equivalent of the abstract art so popular at the time The trend toward less was not entirely foreign In the s Frank Lloyd Wright started building more modest and efficient houses usually around square feet than the spreading two story ones he had designed in the s and the early th century The Case Study Houses commissioned from talented modern architects by California Arts Architecture magazine between and were yet another homegrown influence on the less is more trend Aesthetic effect came from the landscape new materials and forthright detailing In his Case Study House Ralph Rapson may have mispredicted just how mechanical revolution would impact everyday life few American families acquired helicopters though most eventually got clothes dryers but his belief that self sufficiency was both desirable and inevitable was widely shared The postwar American housing style largely reflected the Americans A prosperity and growth B efficiency and practicality C restraint and confidence D pride and faithfulness Which of the following can be inferred from Paragraph about Bauhaus A It was founded by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe B Its designing concept was affected by World War II C Most American architects used to be associated with it D It had a great influence upon American architecture Mies held that elegance of architectural design A was related to large space B was identified with emptiness C was not reliant on abundant decoration D was not associated with efficiency What is true about the apartments Mies built on Chicago s Lake Shore Drive A They ignored details and proportions B They were built with materials popular at that time C They were more spacious than neighboring buildings D They shared some characteristics of abstract art What can we learn about the design of the Case Study House A Mechanical devices were widely used B Natural scenes were taken into consideration C Details were sacrificed for the overall effect D Eco friendly materials were employed Text Will the European Union make it The question would have sounded strange not long ago Now even the project s greatest cheerleaders talk of a continent facing a Bermuda triangle of debt population decline and lower growth As well as those chronic problems the EU faces an acute crisis in its economic core the countries that use the single currency Markets have lost faith that the euro zone s economies weaker or stronger will one day converge thanks to the discipline of sharing a single currency which denies uncompetitive members the quick fix of devaluation Yet the debate about how to save Europe s single currency from disintegration is stuck It is stuck because the euro zone s dominant powers France and Germany agree on the need for greater harmonization within the euro zone but disagree about what to harmonies Germany thinks the euro must be saved by stricter rules on borrowing spending and competitiveness backed by quasi automatic sanctions for governments that do not obey These might include threats to freeze EU funds for poorer regions and EU mega projects and even the suspension of a country s voting rights in EU ministerial councils It insists that economic co ordination should involve all members of the EU club among whom there is a small majority for free market liberalism and economic rigour in the inner core alone Germany fears a small majority favour French interference A southern camp headed by French wants something different European economic government within an inner core of euro zone members Translated that means politicians intervening in monetary policy and a system of redistribution from richer to poorer members via cheaper borrowing for governments through common Eurobonds or complete fiscal transfers Finally figures close to the France government have murmured euro zone members should agree to some fiscal and social harmonization e g curbing competition in corporate tax rates or labour costs It is too soon to write off the EU It remains the world s largest trading block At its best the European project is remarkably liberal built around a single market of rich and poor countries its internal borders are far more open to goods capital and labour than any comparable trading area It is an ambitious attempt to blunt the sharpest edges of globalization and make capitalism benign The EU is faced with so many problems that A it has more or less lost faith in markets B even its supporters begin to feel concerned C some of its member countries plan to abandon euro D it intends to deny the possibility of devaluation The debate over the EU s single currency is stuck because the dominant powers A are competing for the leading position B are busy handling their own crises C fail to reach an agreement on harmonization D disagree on the steps towards disintegration To solve the euro problem Germany proposed that A EU funds for poor regions be increased B stricter regulations be imposed C only core members be involved in economic co ordination D voting rights of the EU members be guaranteed The French proposal of handling the crisis implies that A poor countries are more likely to get funds B strict monetary policy will be applied to poor countries C loans will be readily available to rich countries D rich countries will basically control Eurobonds Regarding the future of the EU the author seems to feel A pessimistic B desperate C conceited D hopeful Part B Directions

unhealthy food and introduce cigarette style warnings to children about the dangers of a poor diet The demands follow comments made last week by the health secretary Andrew Lansley who insisted the government could not force people to make healthy choices and promised to free businesses from public health regulations But senior medical figures want to stop fast food outlets opening near schools restrict advertising of products high in fat salt or sugar and limit sponsorship of sports events by fast food producers such as McDonald s They argue that government action is necessary to curb Britain s addiction to unhealthy food and help halt spiraling rates to obesity diabetes and heart disease Professor Terence Stephenson President of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health said that the consumption of unhealthy food should be seen to be just as damaging as smoking or excessive drinking Thirty years ago it would have been inconceivable to have imagined a ban on smoking in the work place or in pubs and yet that is what we have now Are we willing to be just as courageous in respect of obesity would suggest that we should be said the leader of the UK s children s doctors Lansley has alarmed health campaigners by suggesting he wants industry rather than government to take the lead He said that manufacturers of crisps and candies could play a central role in the Change Life campaign the centrepiece of government efforts to boost healthy eating and fitness He has also criticised the celebrity chef Jamie Oliver s high profile attempt to improve school lunches in England as an example of how lecturing people was not the best way to change their behaviour Stephenson suggested potential restrictions could include banning TV advertisements for foods high in fat salt or sugar before pm and limiting them on billboards or in cinemas If we were really bold we might even begin to think of high calorie fast food in the same way as cigarettes by setting strict limits on advertising product placement and sponsorship of sports events he said Such a move could affect firms such as McDonald s which sponsors the youth coaching scheme run by Football Association Fast food chains should also stop offering inducements such as toys cute animals and mobile phone credit to lure young customer Stephenson said Professor Dinesh Bhugra President of the Royal College of Psychiatrists said If children are taught about the impact that food has on their growth and that some things can harm at least information is available up front He also urged councils to impose fast food free zones around schools and hospitals areas within which takeaways cannot open A Department of Health spokesperson said We need to create a new vision for public health where all of society works together to get healthy and live longer This includes creating a new responsibility deal with business built on social responsibility not state regulation Later this year we will publish a white paper setting out exactly how we will achieve this The food industry will be alarmed that such senior doctors back such radical moves especially the call to use some of the tough tactics that have been deployed against smoking over the last decade A fat taxes should be imposed on fast food producers such as McDonald s Andrew Lansley held that B the government should ban fast food outlets in the neighborhood of schools Terence Stephenson agreed that C lecturing was an effective way to improve school lunches in England Jamie Oliver seemed to believe that D cigarette style warnings should be introduced to children about the dangers of a poor diet Dinesh Bhugra suggested that E the producers of crisps and candies could contribute significantly to the Change Life campaign A

been particularly scorned School districts across the country most recently Los Angeles Unified are revising their thinking on his educational ritual Unfortunately L A Unified has produced an inflexible policy which mandates that with the exception of some advanced courses homework may no longer count for more than of a student s academic grade This rule is meant to address the difficulty that students from impoverished or chaotic homes might have in completing their homework But the policy is unclear and contradictory Certainly no homework should be assigned that students cannot complete on their own or that they cannot do without expensive equipment But if the district is essentially giving a pass to students who do not do their homework because of complicated family lives it is going riskily close to the implication that standards need to be lowered for poor children District administrators say that homework will still be a part of schooling teachers are allowed to assign as much of it as they want But with homework counting for no more than of their grades students can easily skip half their homework and see very little difference on their report cards Some students might do well on state tests without completing their homework but what about the students who performed well on the tests and did their homework It is quite possible that the homework helped Yet rather than empowering teachers to find what works best for their students the policy imposes a flat across the board rule At the same time the policy addresses none of the truly thorny questions about homework If the district finds homework to be unimportant to its students academic achievement it should move to reduce or eliminate the assignments not make them count for almost nothing Conversely if homework matters it should account for a significant portion of the grade Meanwhile this policy does nothing to ensure that the homework students receive is meaningful or appropriate to their age and the subject or that teachers are not assigning more than they are willing to review and correct The homework rules should be put on hold while the school board which is responsible for setting educational policy looks into the matter and conducts public hearings It is not too late for L A Unified to do homework right It is implied in paragraph that nowadays homework A is receiving more criticism B is no longer an educational ritual C is not required for advanced courses D is gaining more preferences L A Unified has made the rule about homework mainly because poor students A tend to have moderate expectations for their education B have asked for a different educational standard C may have problems finishing their homework D have voiced their complaints about homework According to Paragraph one problem with the policy is that it may A discourage students from doing homework B result in students indifference to their report cards C undermine the authority of state tests D restrict teachers power in education As mentioned in Paragraph a key question unanswered about homework is whether A it should be eliminated B it counts much in schooling C it places extra burdens on teachers D it is important for grades A suitable title for this text could be A Wrong Interpretation of an Educational Policy B A Welcomed Policy for Poor Students C Thorny Questions about Homework D A Faulty Approach to Homework Text Pretty in pink adult women do not remember being so obsessed with the colour yet it is pervasive in our young girls lives It is not that pink is intrinsically bad but it is such a tiny slice of the rainbow and though it may celebrate girlhood in one way it also repeatedly and firmly fuses girls identity to appearance Then it presents that connection even among two year olds between girls as not only innocent but as evidence of innocence Looking around I despaired at the singular lack of imagination about girls lives and interests Girls attraction to pink may seem unavoidable somehow encoded in their DNA but according to Jo Paoletti an associate professor of American Studies it is not Children were not colour coded at all until the early th century in the era before domestic washing machines all babies wore white as a practical matter since the only way of getting clothes clean was to boil them What s more both boys and girls wore what were thought of as gender neutral dresses When nursery colours were introduced pink was actually considered the more masculine colour a pastel version of red which was associated with strength Blue with its intimations of the Virgin Mary constancy and faithfulness symbolised femininity It was not until the mid s when amplifying age and sex differences became a dominant children s marketing strategy that pink fully came into its own when it began to seem inherently attractive to girls part of what defined them as female at least for the first few critical years I had not realised how profoundly marketing trends dictated our perception of what is natural to kids including our core beliefs about their psychological development Take the toddler I assumed that phase was something experts developed after years of research into children s behaviour wrong Turns out according to Daniel Cook a historian of childhood consumerism it was popularized as a marketing trick by clothing manufacturers in the s Trade publications counselled department stores that in order to increase sales they should create a third stepping stone between infant wear and older kids clothes It was only after toddler became a common shoppers term that it evolved into a broadly accepted developmental stage Splitting kids or adults into ever tinier categories has proved a sure fire way to boost profits And one of the easiest ways to segment a market is to magnify gender differences or invent them where they did not previously exist By saying it is the rainbow Line Para the author means pink A should not be the sole representation of girlhood B should not be associated with girls innocence C cannot explain girls lack of imagination D cannot influence girls lives and interests According to Paragraph which of the following is true of colours A Colours are encoded in girls DNA B Blue used to be regarded as the colour for girls C Pink used to be a neutral colour in symbolising genders D White is preferred by babies The author suggests that our perception of children s psychological development was much influenced by A the marketing of products for children B the observation of children s nature C researches into children s behavior D studies of childhood consumption We may learn from Paragraph that department stores were advised to A focus on infant wear and older kids clothes B attach equal importance to different genders C classify consumers into smaller groups D create some common shoppers terms It can be concluded that girls attraction to pink seems to be A clearly explained by their inborn tendency B fully understood by clothing manufacturers C mainly imposed by profit driven businessmen D well interpreted by psychological experts Text In a federal judge shook America s biotech industry to its core Companies had won patents for isolated DNA for decades by some of human genes were patented But in March a judge ruled that genes were unpatentable Executives were violently agitated The Biotechnology Industry Organization BIO a trade group assured members that this was just a preliminary step in a longer battle On July th they were relieved at least temporarily A federal appeals court overturned the prior decision ruling that Myriad Genetics could indeed hold patents to two genes that help forecast a woman s risk of breast cancer The chief executive of Myriad a company in Utah said the ruling was a blessing to firms and patients alike But as companies continue their attempts at personalized medicine the courts will remain rather busy The Myriad case itself is probably not over Critics make three main arguments against gene patents a gene is a product of nature so it may not be patented gene patents suppress innovation rather than reward it and patents monopolies restrict access to genetic tests such as Myriad s A growing number seem to agree Last year a federal task force urged reform for patents related to genetic tests In October the Department of Justice filed a brief in the Myriad case arguing that an isolated DNA molecule is no less a product of nature than are cotton fibers that have been separated from cotton seeds Despite the appeals court s decision big questions remain unanswered For example it is unclear whether the sequencing of a whole genome violates the patents of individual genes within it The case may yet reach the Supreme Court AS the industry advances however other suits may have an even greater impact Companies are unlikely to file many more patents for human DNA molecules most are already patented or in the public domain Firms are now studying how genes interact looking for correlations that might be used to determine the causes of disease or predict a drug s efficacy companies are eager to win patents for connecting the dots explains Hans Sauer a lawyer for the BIO Their success may be determined by a suit related to this issue brought by the Mayo Clinic which the Supreme Court will hear in its next term The BIO recently held a convention which included sessions to coach lawyers on the shifting landscape for patents Each meeting was packed It can be learned from paragraph I that the biotech companies would like A their executives to be active B judges to rule out gene patenting C genes to be patentable D the BIO to issue a warning Those who are against gene patents believe that A genetic tests are not reliable B only man made products are patentable C patents on genes depend much on innovation D courts should restrict access to genetic tests According to Hans Sauer companies are eager to win patents for A establishing disease correlations B discovering gene interactions C drawing pictures of genes D identifying human DNA By saying each meeting was packed Line Para the author means that A the Supreme Court was authoritative B the BIO was a powerful organization C gene patenting was a great concern D lawyers were keen to attend conventions Generally speaking the author s attitude toward gene patenting is A critical B supportive C scornful D objective Text The great recession may be over but this era of high joblessness is probably beginning Before it ends it will likely change the life course and character of a generation of young adults And ultimately it is likely to reshape our politics our culture and the character of our society for years No one tries harder than the jobless to find silver linings in this national economic disaster Many said that unemployment while extremely painful had improved them in some ways they had become less materialistic and more financially prudent they were more aware of the struggles of others In limited respects perhaps the recession will leave society better off At the very least it has awoken us from our national fever dream of easy riches and bigger houses and put a necessary end to an era of reckless personal spending But for the most part these benefits seem thin uncertain and far off In The Moral Consequences of Economic Growth the economic historian Benjamin Friedman argues that both inside and outside the U S lengthy periods of economic stagnation or decline have almost always left society more mean spirited and less inclusive and have usually stopped or reversed the advance of rights and freedoms Anti immigrant sentiment typically increases as does conflict between races and classes Income inequality usually falls during a recession but it has not shrunk in this one Indeed this period of economic weakness may reinforce class divides and decrease opportunities to cross them especially for young people The research of Till Von Wachter the economist in Columbia University suggests that not all people graduating into a recession see their life chances dimmed those with degrees from elite universities catch up fairly quickly to where they otherwise would have been if they had graduated in better times it is the masses beneath them that are left behind In the Internet age it is particularly easy to see the resentment that has always been hidden within American society More difficult in the moment is discerning precisely how these lean times are affecting society s character In many respects the U S was more socially tolerant entering this recession than at any time in its history and a variety of national polls on social conflict since then have shown mixed results We will have to wait and see exactly how these hard times will reshape our social fabric But they certainly will shape it and all the more so the longer they extend By saying to find silver linings Line Para the author suggest that the jobless try to A seek subsidies from the government B explore reasons for the unemployment C make profits from the troubled economy D look on the bright side of the recession According to Paragraph the recession has made people A realize the national dream B struggle against each other C challenge their prudence D reconsider their lifestyle Benjamin Friedman believe that economic recessions may A impose a heavier burden on immigrants B bring out more evils of human nature C promote the advance of rights and freedoms D ease conflicts between races and classes The research of Till Von Wachther suggests that in recession graduates from elite universities tend to A lag behind the others due to decreased opportunities B catch up quickly with experienced employees C see their life chances as dimmed as the others D recover more quickly than the others The author thinks that the influence of hard times

this world is at bottom the History of the Great Men who have worked here wrote the Victorian sage Thomas Carlyle Well not any more it is not Suddenly Britain looks to have fallen out with its favourite historical form This could be no more than a passing literary craze but it also points to a broader truth about how we now approach the past less concerned with learning from forefathers and more interested in feeling their pain Today we want empathy not inspiration From the earliest days of the Renaissance the writing of history meant recounting the exemplary lives of great men In Petrarch began work on his rambling writing De Viris Illustribus On Famous Men highlighting the virtus or virtue of classical heroes Petrarch celebrated their greatness in conquering fortune and rising to the top This was the biographical tradition which Niccolo Machiavelli turned on its head In The Prince he championed cunning ruthlessness and boldness rather than virtue mercy and justice as the skills of successful leaders Over time the attributes of greatness shifted The Romantics commemorated the leading painters and authors of their day stressing the uniqueness of the artist s personal experience rather than public glory By contrast the Victorian author Samual Smiles wrote Self Help as a catalogue of the worthy lives of engineers industrialists and explores The valuable examples which they furnish of the power of self help of patient purpose resolute working and steadfast integrity issuing in the formation of truly noble and manly character exhibit wrote Smiles what it is in the power of each to accomplish for himself His biographies of James Walt Richard Arkwright and Josiah Wedgwood were held up as beacons to guide the working man through his difficult life This was all a bit bourgeois for Thomas Carlyle who focused his biographies on the truly heroic lives of Martin Luther Oliver Cromwell and Napoleon Bonaparte These epochal figures represented lives hard to imitate but to be acknowledged as possessing higher authority than mere mortals Not everyone was convinced by such bombast The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles wrote Marx and Engels in The Communist Manifesto For them history did nothing it possessed no immense wealth nor waged battles It is man real living man who does all that And history should be the story of the masses and their record of struggle As such it needed to appreciate the economic realities the social contexts and power relations in which each epoch stood For Men make their own history but they do not make it just as they please they do not make it under circumstances chosen by themselves but under circumstances directly found given and transmitted from the past This was the tradition which revolutionized our appreciation of the past In place of Thomas Carlyle Britain nurtured Christopher Hill EP Thompson and Eric Hobsbawm History from below stood alongside biographies of great men Whole new realms of understanding from gender to race to cultural studies were opened up as scholars unpicked the multiplicity of lost societies And it transformed public history too downstairs became just as fascinating as upstairs A emphasized the virtue of classical heroes Petrarch B highlighted the public glory of the leading artists Niccolo Machiavelli C focused on epochal figures whose lives were hard to imitate Samuel Smiles D opened up new realms of understanding the great men in history Thomas Carlyle E held that history should be the story of the masses and their

how much a modern textile mill has been automated The average mill has only two employees today a man and a dog The man is there to feed the dog and the dog is there to keep the man away from the machines Davidson s article is one of a number of pieces that have recently appeared making the point that the reason we have such stubbornly high unemployment and declining middle class incomes today is largely because of the big drop in demand because of the Great Recession but it is also because of the advances in both globalization and the information technology revolution which are more rapidly than ever replacing labor with machines or foreign workers In the past workers with average skills doing an average job could earn an average lifestyle But today average is officially over Being average just won t earn you what it used to It can t when so many more employers have so much more access to so much more above average cheap foreign labor cheap robotics cheap software cheap automation and cheap genius Therefore everyone needs to find their extra their unique value contribution that makes them stand out in whatever is their field of employment Yes new technology has been eating jobs forever and always will But there s been an acceleration As Davidson notes In the years ending in U S factories shed workers so fast that they erased almost all the gains of the previous years roughly one out of every three manufacturing jobs about million in total disappeared There will always be change new jobs new products new services But the one thing we know for sure is that with each advance in globalization and the I T revolution the best jobs will require workers to have more and better education to make themselves above average In a world where average is officially over there are many things we need to do to support employment but nothing would be more important than passing some kind of G I Bill for the st century that ensures that every American has access to post high school education The joke in Paragraph is used to illustrate A the impact of technological advances B the alleviation of job pressure C the shrinkage of textile mills D the decline of middle class incomes According to Paragraph to be a successful employee one has to A work on cheap software B ask for a moderate salary C adopt an average lifestyle D contribute something unique The quotation in Paragraph explains that A gains of technology have been erased B job opportunities are disappearing at a high speed C factories are making much less money than before D new jobs and services have been offered According to the author to reduce unemployment the most important is A to accelerate the I T revolution B to ensure more education for people C to advance economic globalization D to pass more bills in the st century Which of the following would be the most appropriate title for the text A New Law Takes Effect B Technology Goes Cheap C Average Is Over D Recession Is Bad Text A century ago the immigrants from across the Atlantic included settlers and sojourners Along with the many folks looking to make a permanent home in the United States came those who had no intention to stay and million people arrived while about million departed About a quarter of all Italian immigrants for example eventually returned to Italy for good They even had an affectionate nickname uccelli di passaggio birds of passage Today we are much more rigid about immigrants We divide newcomers into two categories legal or illegal good or bad We hail them as Americans in the making or our broken immigration system and the long political paralysis over how to fix it We don t need more categories but we need to change the way we think about categories We need to look beyond strict definitions of legal and illegal To start we can recognize the new birds of passage those living and thriving in the gray areas We might then begin to solve our immigration challenges Crop pickers violinists construction workers entrepreneurs engineers home health care aides and physicists are among today s birds of passage They are energetic participants in a global economy driven by the flow of work money and ideas They prefer to come and go as opportunity calls them They can manage to have a job in one place and a family in another With or without permission they straddle laws jurisdictions and identities with ease We need them to imagine the United States as a place where they can be productive for a while without committing themselves to staying forever We need them to feel that home can be both here and there and that they can belong to two nations honorably Accommodating this new world of people in motion will require new attitudes on both sides of the immigration battle Looking beyond the culture war logic of right or wrong means opening up the middle ground and understanding that managing immigration today requires multiple paths and multiple outcomes Including some that are not easy to accomplish legally in the existing system Birds of passage refers to those who A immigrate across the Atlantic B leave their home countries for good C stay in a foreign temporarily D find permanent jobs overseas It is implied in paragraph that the current immigration system in the US A needs new immigrant categories B has loosened control over immigrants C should be adopted to meet challenges D has been fixed via political means According to the author today s birds of passage want A financial incentives B a global recognition C opportunities to get regular jobs D the freedom to stay and leave The author suggests that the birds of passage today should be treated A as faithful partners B with economic favors C with legal tolerance D as mighty rivals which of the following would be the most appropriate title for the text A Come and Go Big Mistake B Living and Thriving Great Risk C With or Without Great Risk D Legal or Illegal Big Mistake Text Scientists have found that although we are prone to snap overreactions if we take a moment and think about how we are likely to react we can reduce or even eliminate the negative effects of our quick hard wired responses Snap decisions can be important defense mechanisms if we are judging whether someone is dangerous our brains and bodies are hard wired to react very quickly within milliseconds But we need more time to assess other factors To accurately tell whether someone is sociable studies show we need at least a minute preferably five It takes a while to judge complex aspects of perso nality like neuroticism or open mindedness But snap decisions in reaction to rapid stimuli aren t exclusive to the interpersonal realm Psychologists at the University of Toronto found that viewing a fast food logo for just a few milliseconds primes us to read percent faster even though reading has little to do with eating We unconsciously associate fast food with speed and impatience and carry those impulses into whatever else we re doing Subjects exposed to fast food flashes also tend to think a musical piece lasts too long Yet we can reverse such influences If we know we will overreact to consumer products or housing options when we see a happy face one reason good sales representatives and real estate agents are always smiling we can take a moment before buying If we know female job screeners are more likely to reject attractive female applicants we can help screeners understand their biases or hire outside screeners John Gottman the marriage expert explains that we quickly thin slice information reliably only after we ground such snap reactions in thick sliced long term study When Dr Gottman really wants to assess whether a couple will stay together he invites them to his island retreat for a much longer evaluation two days not two seconds Our ability to mute our hard wired reactions by pausing is what differentiates us from animals dogs can think about the future only intermittently or for a few minutes But historically we have spent about percent of our days contemplating the longer term Although technology might change the way we react it hasn t changed our nature We still have the imaginative capacity to rise above temptation and reverse the high speed trend The time needed in making decisions may A vary according to the urgency of the situation B prove the complexity of our brain reaction C depend on the importance of the assessment D predetermine the accuracy of our judgment Our reaction to a fast food logo shows that snap decisions A can be associative B are not unconscious C can be dangerous D are not impulsive To reverse the negative influences of snap decisions we should A trust our first impression B do as people usually do C think before we act D ask for expert advice John Gottman says that reliable snap reactions are based on A critical assessment B thin sliced study C sensible explanation D adequate information The author s attitude toward reversing the high speed trend is A tolerant B uncertain C optimistic D doubtful Text Europe is not a gender equality heaven In particular the corporate workplace will never be completely family friendly until women are part of senior management decisions and Europe s top corporate governance positions remain overwhelmingly male Indeed women hold only percent of positions on Europe corporate boards The Europe Union is now considering legislation to compel corporate boards to maintain a certain proportion of women up to percent This proposed mandate was born of frustration Last year Europe Commission Vice President Viviane Reding issued a call to voluntary action Reding invited corporations to sign up for gender balance goal of percent female board membership But her appeal was considered a failure only companies took it up Do we need quotas to ensure that women can continue to climb the corporate Ladder fairy as they balance work and family Personally I don t like quotas Reding said recently But I like what the quotas do Quotas get action they open the way to equality and they break through the glass ceiling according to Reding a result seen in France and other countries with legally binding provisions on placing women in top business positions I understand Reding s reluctance and her frustration I don t like quotas either they run counter to my belief in meritocracy government by the capable But when one considers the obstacles to achieving the meritocratic ideal it does look as if a fairer world must be temporarily ordered After all four decades of evidence has now shown that corporations in Europe as the US are evading the meritocratic hiring and promotion of women to top position no matter how much soft pressure is put upon them When women do break through to the summit of corporate power as for example Sheryl Sandberg recently did at Facebook they attract massive attention precisely because they remain the exception to the rule If appropriate pubic policies were in place to help all women whether CEOs or their children s caregivers and all families Sandberg would be no more newsworthy than any other highly capable person living in a more just society In the European corporate workplace generally A women take the lead B men have the final say C corporate governance is overwhelmed D senior management is family friendly The European Union s intended legislation is A a reflection of gender balance B a reluctant choice C a response to Reding s call D a voluntary action According to Reding quotas may help women A get top business positions B see through the glass ceiling C balance work and family D anticipate legal results The author s attitude toward Reding s appeal is one of A skepticism B objectiveness C indifference D approval Women entering top management become headlines due to the lack of A more social justice B massive media attention C suitable public policies D

academics use an array of behavioral research to show that the most rewarding ways to spend money can be counterintuitive Fantasies of great wealth often involve visions of fancy cars and extravagant homes Yet satisfaction with these material purchases wears off fairly quickly What was once exciting and new becomes old hat regret creeps in It is far better to spend money on experiences say Ms Dumn and Mr Norton like interesting trips unique meals or even going to the cinema These purchases often become more valuable with time as stories or memories particularly if they involve feeling more connected to others This slim volume is packed with tips to help wage slaves as well as lottery winners get the most happiness bang for your buck It seems most people would be better off if they could shorten their commutes to work spend more time with friends and family and less of it watching television something the average American spends a whopping two months a year doing and is hardly jollier for it Buying gifts or giving to charity is often more pleasurable than purchasing things for oneself and luxuries are most enjoyable when they are consumed sparingly This is apparently the reason MacDonald s restricts the availability of its popular McRib a marketing trick that has turned the pork sandwich into an object of obsession Readers of Happy Money are clearly a privileged lot anxious about fulfillment not hunger Money may not quite buy happiness but people in wealthier countries are generally happier than those in poor ones Yet the link between feeling good and spending money on others can be seen among rich and poor people around the world and scarcity enhances the pleasure of most things for most people Not everyone will agree with the authors policy ideas which range from mandating more holiday time to reducing tax incentives for American homebuyers But most people will come away from this book believing it was money well spent According to Dumn and Norton which of the following is the most rewarding purchase A A big house B A special tour C A stylish car D A rich meal The author s attitude toward Americans watching TV is A critical B supportive C sympathetic D ambiguous MacRib is mentioned in Paragraph to show that A consumers are sometimes irrational B popularity usually comes after quality C marketing tricks are after effective D rarity generally increases pleasure According to the last paragraph Happy Money A has left much room for readers criticism B may prove to be a worthwhile purchase C has predicted a wider income gap in the US D may give its readers a sense of achievement This text mainly discusses how to A balance feeling good and spending money B spend large sums of money won in lotteries C obtain lasting satisfaction from money spent D become more reasonable in spending on luxuries Text An article in Scientific America has pointed out that empirical research says that actually you think you re more beautiful than you are We have a deep seated need to feel good about ourselves and we naturally employ a number of self enhancing strategies to achieve this Social psychologists have amassed oceans of research into what they call the above average effect or illusory superiority and shown that for example of us rate ourselves as above average in leadership in driving and at getting on well with others all obviously statistical impossibilities We rose tint our memories and put ourselves into self affirming situations We become defensive when criticized and apply negative stereotypes to others to boost our own esteem We stalk around thinking we re hot stuff Psychologist and behavioral scientist Nicholas Epley oversaw a key studying into self enhancement and attractiveness Rather that have people simply rate their beauty compared with others he asked them to identify an original photograph of themselves from a lineup including versions that had been altered to appear more and less attractive Visual recognition reads the study is an automatic psychological process occurring rapidly and intuitively with little or no apparent conscious deliberation If the subjects quickly chose a falsely flattering image which most did they genuinely believed it was really how they looked Epley found no significant gender difference in responses Nor was there any evidence that those who self enhanced the most that is the participants who thought the most positively doctored pictures were real were doing so to make up for profound insecurities In fact those who thought that the images higher up the attractiveness scale were real directly corresponded with those who showed other makers for having higher self esteem I don t think the findings that we have are any evidence of personal delusion says Epley It s a reflection simply of people generally thinking well of themselves If you are depressed you won t be self enhancing Knowing the results of Epley s study it makes sense that why people hate photographs of themselves viscerally on one level they don t even recognise the person in the picture as themselves Facebook therefore is a self enhancer s paradise where people can share only the most flattering photos the cream of their wit style beauty intellect and lifestyle It s not that people s profiles are dishonest says Catalina Toma of Wiscon Madison University but they portray an idealized version of themselves According to the first paragraph social psychologists have found that A our self ratings are unrealistically high B illusory superiority is baseless effect C our need for leadership is unnatural D self enhancing strategies are ineffective Visual recognition is believed to be people s A rapid watching B conscious choice C intuitive response D automatic self defence Epley found that people with higher self esteem tended to A underestimate their insecurities B believe in their attractiveness C cover up their depressions D oversimplify their illusions The word viscerally Para is closest in meaning to A instinctively B occasionally C particularly D aggressively It can be inferred that Facebook is self enhancer s paradise because people can A present their dishonest profiles B define their traditional life styles C share their intellectual pursuits D withhold their unflattering sides Text The concept of man versus machine is at least as old as the industrial revolution but this phenomenon tends to be most acutely felt during economic downturns and fragile recoveries And yet it would be a mistake to think we are right now simply experiencing the painful side of a boom and bust cycle Certain jobs have gone away for good outmoded by machines Since technology has such an insatiable appetite for eating up human jobs this phenomenon will continue to restructure our economy in ways we can t immediately foresee When there is exponential improvement in the price and performance of technology jobs that were once thought to be immune from automation suddenly become threatened This argument has attracted a lot of attention via the success of the book Race Against the Machine by Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee who both hail from MIT s Center for Digital Business This is a powerful argument and a scary one And yet John Hagel author of The Power of Pull and other books says Brynjolfsson and McAfee miss the reason why these jobs are so vulnerable to technology in the first place Hagel says we have designed jobs in the U S that tend to be tightly scripted and highly standardized ones that leave no room for individual initiative or creativity In short these are the types of jobs that machines can perform much better at than human beings That is how we have put a giant target sign on the backs of American workers Hagel says It s time to reinvent the formula for how work is conducted since we are still relying on a very th century notion of work Hagel says In our rapidly changing economy we more than ever need people in the workplace who can take initiative and exercise their imagination to respond to unexpected events That s not something machines are good at They are designed to perform very predictable activities As Hagel notes Brynjolfsson and McAfee indeed touched on this point in their book We need to reframe race against the machine as race with the machine In other words we need to look at the ways in which machines can augment human labor rather than replace it So then the problem is not really about technology but rather how do we innovate our institutions and our work practices According to the first paragraph economic downturns would A ease the competition of man vs machine B highlight machines threat to human jobs C provoke a painful technological revolution D outmode our current economic structure The authors of Race Against the Machine argue that A technology is diminishing man s job opportunities B automation is accelerating technological development C certain jobs will remain intact after automation D man will finally win the race against machine Hagel argues that jobs in the U S are often A performed by innovative minds B scripted with an individual style C standardized without a clear target D designed against human creativity According to the last paragraph Brynjolfsson and McAfee discussed A the predictability of machine behavior in practice B the formula for how work is conducted efficiently CJ the ways machines replace human labor in modern times D the necessity of human involvement in the workplace Which of the following could be the most appropriate title for the text A How to Innovate Our Work Practices B Machines Will Replace Human Labor C Can We Win the Race Against Machines D Economic Downturns Stimulate Innovations Text When the government talks about infrastructure contributing to the economy the focus is usually on roads railways broadband and energy Housing is seldom mentioned Why is that To some extent the housing sector must shoulder the blame We have not been good at communicating the real value that housing can contribute to economic growth Then there is the scale of the typical housing project It is hard to shove for attention among multibillion pound infrastructure project so it is inevitable that the attention is focused elsewhere But perhaps the most significant reason is that the issue has always been so politically charged Nevertheless the affordable housing situation is desperate Waiting lists increase all the time and we are simply not building enough new homes The comprehensive spending review offers an opportunity for the government to help rectify this It needs to put historical prejudices to one side and take some steps to address our urgent housing need There are some indications that it is preparing to do just that The communities minister Don Foster has hinted that George Osborne Chancellor of the Exchequer may introduce more flexibility to the current cap on the amount that local authorities can borrow against their housing stock debt Evidence shows that extra new homes could be built over the next five years if the cap were lifted increasing GDP by Ministers should also look at creating greater certainty in the rental environment which would have a significant impact on the ability of registered providers to fund new developments from revenues But it is not just down to the government While these measures would be welcome in the short term we must face up to the fact that the existing bn programme of grants to fund new affordable housing set to expire in is unlikely to be extended beyond then The Labour party has recently announced that it will retain a large part of the coalition s spending plans if returns to power The housing sector needs to accept that we are very unlikely to ever return to era of large scale public grants We need to adjust to this changing climate The author believes that the housing sector A has attracted much attention B involves certain political factors C shoulders too much responsibility D has lost its real value in economy It can be learned that affordable housing has A increased its home supply B offered spending opportunities C suffered government biases D disappointed the government According to Paragraph George Osborne may A allow greater government debt for housing B stop local authorities from building homes C prepare to reduce housing stock debt D release a lifted GDP growth forecast It can be inferred that a stable rental environment would A lower the costs of registered providers B lessen the impact of government interference C contribute to funding new developments D relieve the ministers of responsibilities The author believes that after the government may A implement more policies to support housing B review the need for large scale public grants C renew the affordable housing grants programme D stop generous funding to the housing sector Part B Directions Read the following text

projecting into Utah s Great Salt Lake or Roden Crater an extinct volcano in Arizona which James Turrell has been transforming into an immense naked eye observatory since Richard Long s A Line Made by Walking however involved nothing more strenuous than a minute train ride from Waterloo Having got off somewhere in suburbia the artist walked backwards and forwards over a piece of grass until the squashed turf formed a line a kind of drawing on the land Emerging in the late Sixties and reaching a peak in the Seventies Land Art was one of a range of new forms including Body Art Performance Art Action Art and Installation Art which pushed art beyond the traditional confines of the studio and gallery Rather than portraying landscape land artists used the physical substance of the land itself as their medium The message of this survey of British land art the most comprehensive to date is that the British variant typified by Long s piece was not only more domestically scaled but a lot quirkier than its American counterpart Indeed while you might assume that an exhibition of Land Art would consist only of records of works rather than the works themselves Long s photograph of his work is the work Since his action is in the past the photograph is its sole embodiment That might seem rather an obscure point but it sets the tone for an exhibition that contains a lot of black and white photographs and relatively few natural objects Long is Britain s best known Land Artist and his Stone Circle a perfect ring of purplish rocks from Portishead beach laid out on the gallery floor represents the elegant rarefied side of the form The Boyle Family on the other hand stand for its dirty urban aspect Comprising artists Mark Boyle and Joan Hills and their children they recreated random sections of the British landscape on gallery walls Their Olaf Street Study a square of brick strewn waste ground is one of the few works here to embrace the mundanity that characterises most of our experience of the landscape most of the time Parks feature particularly in the earlier works such as John Hilliard s very funny Across the Park in which a long haired stroller is variously smiled at by a pretty girl and unwittingly assaulted in a sequence of images that turn out to be different parts of the same photograph Generally however British land artists preferred lo get away from towns gravitating towards landscapes that are traditionally considered beautiful such as the Lake District or the Wiltshire Downs While it probably wasn t apparent at the time much of this work is permeated by a spirit of romantic escapism that the likes of Wordsworth would have readily understood Derek Jarman s yellow tinted film Towards Avebury a collection of long mostly still shots of the Wilts hire landscape evokes a tradition of English landscape painting stretching from Samuel Palmer to Paul Nash In the case of Hamish Fulton you can t help feeling that the Scottish artist has simply found a way of making his love of walking pay A typical work such as Seven Days consists of a single beautiful black and white photograph taken on an epic walk with the mileage and number of days taken listed beneath British Land Art as shown in this well selected but relatively modestly scaled exhibition wasn t about imposing on the landscape more a kind of landscape orientated light conceptual art

at home than at work Researchers measured people s cortisol which is a stress marker while they were at work and while they were at home and found it higher at what is supposed to be a place of refuge Further contradicting conventional wisdom we found that women as well as men have lower levels of stress at work than at home writes one of the researchers Sarah Damaske In fact women even say they feel better at work she notes It is men not women who report being happier at home than at work Another surprise is that the findings hold true for both those with children and without but more so for nonparents This is why people who work outside the home have better health What the study doesn t measure is whether people are still doing work when they re at home whether it is household work or work brought home from the office For many men the end of the workday is a time to kick back For women who stay home they never get to leave the office And for women who work outside the home they often are playing catch up with household tasks With the blurring of roles and the fact that the home front lags well behind the workplace in making adjustments for working women it s not surprising that women are more stressed at home But it s not just a gender thing At work people pretty much know what they re supposed to be doing working marking money doing the tasks they have to do in order to draw an income The bargain is very pure Employee puts in hours of physical or mental labor and employee draws out life sustaining moola On the home front however people have no such clarity Rare is the household in which the division of labor is so clinically and methodically laid out There are a lot of tasks to be done there are inadequate rewards for most of them Your home colleagues your family have no clear rewards for their labor they need to be talked into it or if they re teenagers threatened with complete removal of all electronic devices Plus they re your family You cannot fire your family You never really get to go home from home So it s not surprising that people are more stressed at home Not only are the tasks apparently infinite the co workers are much harder to motivate According to Paragraph most previous surveys found that home A was an unrealistic place for relaxation B generated more stress than the workplace C was an ideal place for stress measurement D offered greater relaxation than the workplace According to Damaske who are likely to be the happiest at home A Working mothers B Childless husbands C Childless wives D Working fathers The blurring of working women s roles refers to the fact that A they are both bread winners and housewives B their home is also a place for kicking back C there is often much housework left behind D it is difficult for them to leave their office The word moola Line Para most probably means A energy B skills C earnings D nutrition The home front differs from the workplace in that A home is hardly a cozier working environment B division of labor at home is seldom clear cut C household tasks are generally more motivating D family labor is often adequately rewarded Text For years studies have found that first generation college students those who do not have a parent with a college degree lag other students on a range of education achievement factors Their grades are lower and their dropout rates are higher But since such students are most likely to advance economically if they succeed in higher education colleges and universities have pushed for decades to recruit more of them This has created a paradox in that recruiting first generation students but then watching many of them fail means that higher education has continued to reproduce and widen rather than close an achievement gap based on social class according to the depressing beginning of a paper forthcoming in the journal Psychological Science But the article is actually quite optimistic as it outlines a potential solution to this problem suggesting that an approach which involves a one hour next to no cost program can close percent of the achievement gap measured by such factors as grades between first generation and other students The authors of the paper are from different universities and their findings are based on a study involving students who completed the project at an unnamed private university First generation was defined as not having a parent with a four year college degree Most of the first generation students percent were recipients of Pell Grants a federal grant for undergraduates with financial need while this was true only for percent of the students with at least one parent with a four year degree Their thesis that a relatively modest intervention could have a big impact was based on the view that first generation students may be most lacking not in potential but in practical knowledge about how to deal with the issues that face most college students They cite past research by several authors to show that this is the gap that must be narrowed to close the achievement gap Many first generation students struggle to navigate the middle class culture of higher education learn the rules of the game and take advantage of college resources they write And this becomes more of a problem when colleges don t talk about the class advantages and disadvantages of different groups of students Because US colleges and universities seldom acknowledge how social class can affect students educational experience many first generation students lack sight about why they are struggling and do not understand how students like them can improve Recruiting more first generation students has A reduced their dropout rates B narrowed the achievement gap C missed its original purpose D depressed college students The authors of the research article are optimistic because A the problem is solvable B their approach is costless C the recruiting rate has increased D their finding appeal to students The study suggests that most first generation students A study at private universities B are from single parent families C are in need of financial support D have failed their college The authors of the paper believe that first generation students A are actually indifferent to the achievement gap B can have a potential influence on other students C may lack opportunities to apply for research projects D are inexperienced in handing their issues at college We may infer from the last paragraph that A universities often reject the culture of the middle class B students are usually to blame for their lack of resources C social class greatly helps enrich educational experiences D colleges are partly responsible for the problem in question Text Even in traditional offices the lingua franca of corporate America has gotten much more emotional and much more right brained than it was years ago said Harvard Business School professor Nancy Koehn She started spinning off examples If you and I parachuted back to Fortune companies in we would see much less frequent use of terms like journey mission passion There were goals there were strategies there were objectives but we didn t talk about energy we didn t talk about passion Koehn pointed out that this new era of corporate vocabulary is very team oriented and not by coincidence Let s not forget sports in male dominated corporate America it s still a big deal It s not explicitly conscious it s the idea that I m a coach and you re my team and we re in this together There are lots and lots of CEOs in very different companies but most think of themselves as coaches and this is their team and they want to win These terms are also intended to infuse work with meaning and as Khurana points out increase allegiance to the firm You have the importation of terminology that historically used to be associated with non profit organizations and religious organizations terms like vision values passion and purpose said Khurana This new focus on personal fulfillment can help keep employees motivated amid increasingly loud debates over work life balance The mommy wars of the s are still going on today prompting arguments about why women still can t have it all and books like Sheryl Sandberg s Lean In whose title has become a buzzword in its own right Terms like unplug offline life hack bandwidth and capacity are all about setting boundaries between the office and the home But if your work is your passion you ll be more likely to devote yourself to it even if that means going home for dinner and then working long after the kids are in bed But this seems to be the irony of office speak Everyone makes fun of it but managers love it companies depend on it and regular people willingly absorb it As Nunberg once said You can get people to think it s nonsense at the same time that you buy into it In a workplace that s fundamentally indifferent to your life and its meaning office speak can help you figure out how you relate to your work and how your work defines who you are According to Nancy Koehn office language has become A more emotional B more objective C less energetic D less strategic Team oriented corporate vocabulary is closely related to A historical incidents B gender difference C sports culture D athletic executives Khurana believes that the importation of terminology aims to A revive historical terms B promote company image C foster corporate cooperation D strengthen employee loyalty It can be inferred that Lean In A voices for working women B appeals to passionate workaholics C triggers debates among mommies D praises motivated employees Which of the following statements is true about office speak A Managers admire it but avoid it B Linguists believe it to be nonsense C Companies find it to be fundamental D Regular people mock it but accept it Text Many people talked of the new jobs the Labor Department reported for June along with the drop in the unemployment rate to percent as good news And they were right For now it appears the economy is creating jobs at a decent pace We still have a long way to go to get back to full employment but at least we are now finally moving forward at a faster pace However there is another important part of the jobs picture that was largely overlooked There was a big jump in the number of people who report voluntarily working part time This figure is now percent above its year ago level Before explaining the connection to the Obamacare it is worth making an important distinction Many people who work part time jobs actually want full time jobs They take part time work because this is all they can get An increase in involuntary part time work is evidence of weakness in the labor market and it means that many people will be having a very hard time making ends meet There was an increase in involuntary part time in June but the general direction has been down Involuntary part time employment is still far higher than before the recession but it is down by percent from its year ago level We know the difference between voluntary and involuntary part time employment because people tell us The survey used by the Labor Department asks people if they worked less than hours in the reference week If the answer is yes they are classified as working part time The survey asks whether they worked less than hours in that week because they wanted to work less than full time or because they had no choice They are only classified as voluntary part time workers if they tell the survey taker they chose to work less than hours a week The issue of voluntary part time relates to Obamacare because one of the main purposes was to allow people to get insurance outside of employment For many people especially those with serious health conditions or family members with serious health conditions before Obamacare the only way to get insurance was through a job that provided health insurance However Obamacare has allowed more than million people to either get insurance through Medicaid or the exchanges These are people who may previously have felt the need to get a full time job that provided insurance in order to cover themselves and their families With Obamacare there is no longer a link between employment and insurance Which part of the jobs picture was neglected A The prospect of a thriving job market B The increase of voluntary part time market C The possibility of full employment D The acceleration of job creation Many people work part time because they A prefer part time jobs to full time jobs B feel that is enough to make ends meet C cannot get their hands on full time jobs D haven t seen the weakness of the market Involuntary part time employment in the US A is harder to acquire than one year ago B shows a general tendency of decline C satisfies the real need of the jobless D is lower than before the recession It can be learned that with Obamacare A it is no longer easy for part timers to get insurance B employment is no longer a precondition to get insurance C it is still challenging to get insurance for family members D full time employment is still essential for insurance

loss a friendship a romantic relationship or a house Hard times may hold you down at what usually seems like the most inopportune time but you should remember that they won t last forever When our time of mourning is over we press forward stronger with a greater understanding and respect for life Furthermore these losses make us mature and eventually move us toward future opportunities for growth and happiness I want to share these old truths I ve learned along the way Fear is both useful and harmful This normal human reaction is used to protect us by signaling danger and preparing us to deal with it Unfortunately people create inner barriers with a help of exaggerating fears My favorite actor Will Smith once said Fear is not real It is a product of thoughts you create Do not misunderstand me Danger is very real But fear is a choice I do completely agree that fears are just the product of our luxuriant imagination If you are surrounded by problems and cannot stop thinking about the past try to focus on the present moment Many of us are weighed down by the past or anxious about the future You may feel guilt over your past but you are poisoning the present with the things and circumstances you cannot change Value the present moment and remember how fortunate you are to be alive Enjoy the beauty of the world around and keep the eyes open to see the possibilities before you Happiness is not a point of future and not a moment from the past but a mindset that can be designed into the present Sometimes it is easy to feel bad because you are going through tough times You can be easily caught up by life problems that you forget to pause and appreciate the things you have Only strong people prefer to smile and value their life instead of crying and complaining about something No matter how isolated you might feel and how serious the situation is you should always remember that you are not alone Try to keep in mind that almost everyone respects and wants to help you if you are trying to make a good change in your life especially your dearest and nearest people You may have a circle of friends who provide constant good humor help and companionship If you have no friends or relatives try to participate in several online communities full of people who are always willing to share advice and encouragement Today many people find it difficult to trust their own opinion and seek balance by gaining objectivity from external sources This way you devalue your opinion and show that you are incapable of managing your own life When you are struggling to achieve

Companies located in place with happier people invest more according to a recent research paper firms in happy places spend more on R D research and development That s because happiness is linked to the kind of longer term thinking for making investments for the future The researchers wanted to know if the and inclination for risk taking that come with happiness would the way companies invested So they compared U S cities average happiness by Gallup polling with the investment activity of publicly traded firms in those areas enough firms investment and R D intensity were correlated with the happiness of the area in which they were But is it really happiness that s linked to investment or could something else about happier cities why firms there spend more on R D To find out the researchers controlled for various that might make firms more likely to invest like size industry and sales and for indicators that a place was to live in like growth in wages or population The link between happiness and investment generally even after accounting for these things The correlation between happiness and investment was particularly strong for younger firms which the authors to less confined decision making process and the possible presence of younger and less managers who are more likely to be influenced by sentiment The relationship was stronger in places where happiness was spread more Firms seem to invest more in places where most people are relatively happy rather than in places with happiness inequality this doesn t prove that happiness causes firms to invest more or to take a longer term view the authors believe it at least at that possibility It s not hard to imagine that local culture and sentiment would help how executives think about the future It surely

essential for learning computer science in college Students without experience can catch up after a few introductory courses said Tom Cortina the assistant dean at Carnegie Mellon s School of Computer Science However Cortina said early exposure is beneficial When younger kids learn computer science they learn that it s not just a confusing endless string of letters and numbers but a tool to build apps or create artwork or test hypotheses It s not as hard for them to transform their thought processes as it is for older students Breaking down problems into bite sized chunks and using code to solve them becomes normal Giving more children this training could increase the number of people interested in the field and help fill the jobs gap Cortina said Students also benefit from learning something about coding before they get to college where introductory computer science classes are packed to the brim which can drive the less experienced or determined students away The Flatiron School where people pay to learn programming started as one of the many coding bootcamps that s become popular for adults looking for a career change The high schoolers get the same curriculum but we try to gear lessons toward things they re interested in said Victoria Friedman an instructor For instance one of the apps the students are developing suggests movies based on your mood The students in the Flatiron class probably won t drop out of high school and build the next Facebook Programming languages have a quick turnover so the Ruby on Rails language they learned may not even be relevant by the time they enter the job market But the skills they learn how to think logically through a problem and organize the results apply to any coding language said Deborah Seehorn an education consultant for the state of North Carolina Indeed the Flatiron students might not go into IT at all But creating a future army of coders is not the sole purpose of the classes These kids are going to be surrounded by computers in their pockets in their offices in their homes for the rest of their lives The younger they learn how computers think how to coax the machine into producing what they want the earlier they learn that they have the power to do that the better Cortina holds that early exposure to computer science makes it easier to A complete future job training B remodel the way of thinking C formulate logical hypotheses D perfect artwork production In delivering lessons for high schoolers Flatiron has considered their A experience B academic backgrounds C career prospects D interest Deborah Seehorn believes that the skills learned at Flatiron will A help students learn other computer languages B have to be upgraded when new technologies come C need improving when students look for jobs D enable students to make big quick money According to the last paragraph Flatiron students are expected to A compete with a future army of programmers B stay longer in the information technology industry C become better prepared for the digitalized world D bring forth innovative computer technologies The word coax Para is closest in meaning to A challenge B persuade C frighten D misguide Text Biologists estimate that as many as million lesser prairie chickens a kind of bird living on stretching grasslands once lent red to the often grey landscape of the midwestern and southwestern United States But just some birds remain today occupying about of the species historic range The crash was a major reason the U S Fish and Wildlife Service USFWS decided to formally list the bird as threatened The lesser prairie chicken is in a desperate situation said USFWS Director Daniel Ashe Some environmentalists however were disappointed They had pushed the agency to designate the bird as endangered a status that gives federal officials greater regulatory power to crack down on threats But Ashe and others argued that the threatened tag gave the federal government flexibility to try out new potentially less confrontational conservations approaches In particular they called for forging closer collaborations with western state governments which are often uneasy with federal action and with the private landowners who control an estimated of the prairie chicken s habitat Under the plan for example the agency said it would not prosecute landowner or businesses that unintentionally kill harm or disturb the bird as long as they had signed a range wide management plan to restore prairie chicken habitat Negotiated by USFWS and the states the plan requires individuals and businesses that damage habitat as part of their operations to pay into a fund to replace every acre destroyed with new acres of suitable habitat The fund will also be used to compensate landowners who set aside habitat USFWS also set an interim goal of restoring prairie chicken populations to an annual average of birds over the next years And it gives the Western Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies WAFWA a coalition of state agencies the job of monitoring progress Overall the idea is to let states remain in the driver s seat for managing the species Ashe said Not everyone buys the win win rhetoric Some Congress members are trying to block the plan and at least a dozen industry groups four states and three environmental groups are challenging it in federal court Not surprisingly industry groups and states generally argue it goes too far environmentalists say it doesn t go far enough The federal government is giving responsibility for managing the bird to the same industries that are pushing it to extinction says biologist Jay Lininger The major reason for listing the lesser prairie as threatened is A its drastically decreased population B the underestimate of the grassland acreage C a desperate appeal from some biologists D the insistence of private landowners The threatened tag disappointed some environmentalists in that it A was a give in to governmental pressure B would involve fewer agencies in action C granted less federal regulatory power D went against conservation policies It can be learned from Paragraph that unintentional harm doers will not be prosecuted if they A agree to pay a sum for compensation B volunteer to set up an equally big habitat C offer to support the WAFWA monitoring job D promise to raise funds for USFWS operations According to Ashe the leading role in managing the species is A the federal government B the wildlife agencies C the landowners D the states Jay Lininger would most likely support A industry groups B the win win rhetoric C environmental groups D the plan under challenge Text That everyone s too busy these days is a clich But one specific complaint is made especially mournfully There s never any time to read What makes the problem thornier is that the usual time management techniques don t seem sufficient The web s full of articles offering tips on making time to read Give up TV or Carry a book with you at all times But in my experience using such methods to free up the odd minutes doesn t work Sit down to read and the flywheel of work related thoughts keeps spinning or else you re so exhausted that a challenging book s the last thing you need The modern mind Tim Parks a novelist and critic writes is overwhelmingly inclined toward communication It is not simply that one is interrupted it is that one is actually inclined to interruption Deep reading requires not just time but a special kind of time which can t be obtained merely by becoming more efficient In fact becoming more efficient is part of the problem Thinking of time as a resource to be maximised means you approach it instrumentally judging any given moment as well spent only in so far as it advances progress toward some goal Immersive reading by contrast depends on being willing to risk inefficiency goallessness even time wasting Try to slot it as a to do list item and you ll manage only goal focused reading useful sometimes but not the most fulfilling kind The future comes at us like empty bottles along an unstoppable and nearly infinite conveyor belt writes Gary Eberle in his book Sacred Time and we feel a pressure to fill these different sized bottles days hours minutes as they pass for if they get by without being filled we will have wasted them No mind set could be worse for losing yourself in a book So what does work Perhaps surprisingly scheduling regular times for reading You d think this might fuel the efficiency mind set but in fact Eberle notes such ritualistic behaviour helps us step outside time s flow into soul time You could limit distractions by reading only physical books or on single purpose e readers Carry a book with you at all times can actually work too providing you dip in often enough so that reading becomes the default state from which you temporarily surface to take care of business before dropping back down On a really good day it no longer feels as if you re making time to read but just reading and making time for everything else The usual time management techniques don t work because A what they can offer does not ease the modern mind B what challenging books demand is repetitive reading C what people often forget is carrying a book with them D what deep reading requires cannot be guaranteed The empty bottles metaphor illustrates that people feel a pressure to A update their to do lists B make passing time fulfilling C carry their plans through D pursue carefree reading Eberle would agree that scheduling regular times for reading helps A encourage the efficiency mind set B develop online reading habits C promote ritualistic reading D achieve immersive reading Carry a book with you at

backdrop of drastic changes in economy and population structure younger Americans are drawing a new st century road map to success a latest poll has found Across generational lines Americans continue to prize many of the same traditional milestones of a successful life including getting married having children owning a home and retiring in their sixties But while young and old mostly agree on what constitutes the finish line of a fulfilling life they offer strikingly different paths for reaching it Young people who are still getting started in life were more likely than older adults to prioritize personal fulfillment in their work to believe they will advance their careers most by regularly changing jobs to favor communities with more public services and a faster pace of life to agree that couples should be financially secure before getting married or having children and to maintain that children are best served by two parents working outside the home the survey found From career to community and family these contrasts suggest that in the aftermath of the searing Great Recession those just starting out in life are defining priorities and expectations that will increasingly spread through virtually all aspects of American life from consumer preferences to housing patterns to politics Young and old converge on one key point Overwhelming majorities of both groups said they believe it is harder for young people today to get started in life than it was for earlier generations While younger people are somewhat more optimistic than their elders about the prospects for those starting out today big majorities in both groups believe those just getting started in life face a tougher climb than earlier generations in reaching such signpost achievements as securing a good paying job starting a family managing debt and finding affordable housing Pete Schneider considers the climb tougher today Schneider a year old auto technician from the Chicago suburbs says he struggled to find a job after graduating from college Even now that he is working steadily he said I can t afford to pay my monthly mortgage payments on my own so I have to rent rooms out to people to make that happen Looking back he is struck that his parents could provide a comfortable life for their children even though neither had completed college when he was young I still grew up in an upper middle class home with parents who didn t have college degrees Schneider said I don t think people are capable of that anymore One cross generation mark of a successful life is A trying out different lifestyles B having a family with children C working beyond retirement age D setting up a profitable business It can be learned from Paragraph that young people tend to A favor a slower life pace B hold an occupation longer C attach importance to pre marital finance D give priority to childcare outside the home The priorities and expectations defined by the young will A become increasingly clear B focus on materialistic issues C depend largely on political preferences D reach almost all aspects of American life Both young and old agree that A good paying jobs are less available B the old made more life achievements C housing loans today are easy to obtain D getting established is harder for the young Which of the following is true about Schneider A He found a dream job after graduating from college B His parents believe working steadily is a must for success C His parents good life has little to do with a college degree D He thinks his job as a technician quite challenging Part B Directions Read the following text and answer the questions by choosing the most suitable subheading from the list A G for each numbered paragraph There are two extra Subheadings which you do not need to use Mark your answers on the ANSWER SHEET points Be silly Have fun Ask for help Express your emotions Don t overthink it Be easily pleased Notice things As adults it seems that we re constantly pursuing happiness often with mixed results Yet children appear to have it down to an art and for the most part they don t need self help books or therapy Instead they look after their wellbeing instinctively and usually more effectively than we do as grownups Perhaps it s time to learn a few lessons from them What does a child do when he s sad He cries When he s angry He shouts Scared Probably a bit of both As we grow up we learn to control our emotions so they are manageable and don t dictate our behaviours which is in many ways a good thing But too often we take this process too far and end up suppressing emotions especially negative ones That s about as effective as brushing dirt under a carpet and can even make us ill What we need to do is find a way to acknowledge and express what we feel appropriately and then again like children move on A couple of Christmases ago my youngest stepdaughter who was years old at the time got a Superman T shirt for Christmas It cost less than a fiver but she was overjoyed and couldn t stop talking about it Too often we believe that a new job bigger house or better car will he the magic silver bullet that will allow us to finally be content but the reality is these things have little lasting impact on our happiness levels Instead being grateful for small things every day is a much better way to improve wellbeing Have you ever noticed how much children laugh If we adults could indulge in a bit of silliness and giggling we would reduce the stress hormones in our bodies increase good hormones like endorphins improve blood flow to our hearts and even have a greater chance of fighting off infection All of which would of course have a positive effect on our happiness levels The problem with being a grownup is that there s an awful lot of serious stuff to deal with work mortgage payments figuring out what to cook for dinner But as adults we also have the luxury of being able to control our own diaries and it s important that we schedule in time to enjoy the things we love Those things might be social sporting creative or completely random dancing around the living room anyone it doesn t matter so long as they re enjoyable and not likely to have negative side effects such as drinking too much alcohol or going on a wild spending spree if you re on a tight budget Having said all of the above it s important to add that we shouldn t try too hard to be happy Scientists tell us this can backfire and actually have a negative impact on our wellbeing As the Chinese philosopher Chuang Tzu is reported to have said Happiness is the absence of striving for happiness And in that once more we need to look to the example of our children to whom happiness is not a goal but a natural byproduct

customers into spending as much time as possible within its doors The reason for this is simple The longer you stay in the store the more stuff you ll see and the more stuff you see the more you ll buy And supermarkets contain a lot of stuff The average supermarket according to the Food Marketing Institute carries some different items and many carry tens of thousands more The sheer volume of available choice is enough to send shoppers into a state of information overload According to brain scan experiments the demands of so much decision making quickly become too much for us After about minutes of shopping most people stop struggling to be rationally selective and instead begin shopping emotionally which is the point at which we accumulate the percent of stuff in our cart that we

Without jobs to give their lives people will simply become lazy and depressed today s unemployed don t seem to be having a great time One Gallup poll found that percent of Americans who have been unemployed for at least a year report having depression double the rate for Americans Also some research suggests that the for rising rates of mortality mental health problems and addicting poorly educated middle aged people is shortage of well paid jobs Perhaps this is why many the agonizing dullness of a jobless future But it doesn t follow from findings like these that a world without work

runners set off to run km around their local park The Parkrun phenomenon began with a dozen friends and has inspired events in the UK and more abroad Events are free staffed by thousands of volunteers Runners range from four years old to grandparents their times range from Andrew Baddeley s world record minutes seconds up to an hour Parkrun is succeeding where London s Olympic legacy is failing Ten years ago on Monday it was announced that the Games of the th Olympiad would be in London Planning documents pledged that the great legacy of the Games would be to level a nation of sport lovers away from their couches The population would be fitter healthier and produce more winners It has not happened The number of adults doing weekly sport did rise by nearly million in the run up to but the general population was growing faster Worse the numbers are now falling at an accelerating rate The opposition claims primary school pupils doing at least two hours of sport a week have nearly halved Obesity has risen among adults and children Official retrospections continue as to why London failed to inspire a generation The success of Parkrun offers answers Parkun is not a race but a time trial Your only competitor is the clock The ethos welcomes anybody There is as much joy over a puffed out first timer being clapped over the line as there is about top talent shining The Olympic bidders by contrast wanted to get more people doing sports and to produce more elite athletes The dual aim was mixed up The stress on success over taking part was intimidating for newcomers Indeed there is something a little absurd in the state getting involved in the planning of such a fundamentally grassroots concept as community sports associations If there is a role for government it should really be getting involved in providing common goods making sure there is space for playing fields and the money to pave tennis and netball courts and encouraging the provision of all these activities in schools But successive governments have presided over selling green spaces squeezing money from local authorities and declining attention on sport in education Instead of wordy worthy strategies future governments need to do more to provide the conditions for sport to thrive Or at least not make them worse According to Paragraph Parkrun has A gained great popularity B created many jobs C strengthened community ties D become an official festival The author believes that London s Olympic legacy has failed to A boost population growth B promote sport participation C improve the city s image D increase sport hours in schools Parkrun is different from Olympic games in that it A aims at discovering talents B focuses on mass competition C does not emphasize elitism D does not attract first timers With regard to mass sport the author holds that governments should A organize grassroots sports events B supervise local sports associations C increase funds for sports clubs D invest in public sports facilities The author s attitude to what UK governments have done for sports is A tolerant B critical C uncertain D sympathetic Text With so much focus on children s use of screens it s easy for parents to forget about their own screen use Tech is designed to really suck on you in says Jenny Radesky in her study of digital play and digital products are there to promote maximal engagement It makes it hard to disengage and leads to a lot of bleed over into the family routine Radesky has studied the use of mobile phones and tablets at mealtimes by giving mother child pairs a food testing exercise She found that mothers who sued devices during the exercise started percent fewer verbal and percent fewer nonverbal interactions with their children During a separate observation she saw that phones became a source of tension in the family Parents would be looking at their emails while the children would be making excited bids for their attention Infants are wired to look at parents faces to try to understand their world and if those faces are blank and unresponsive as they often are when absorbed in a device it can be extremely disconcerting foe the children Radesky cites the still face experiment devised by developmental psychologist Ed Tronick in the s In it a mother is asked to interact with her child in a normal way before putting on a blank expression and not giving them any visual social feedback The child becomes increasingly distressed as she tries to capture her mother s attention Parents don t have to be exquisitely parents at all times but there needs to be a balance and parents need to be responsive and sensitive to a child s verbal or nonverbal expressions of an emotional need says Radesky On the other hand Tronick himself is concerned that the worries about kids use of screens are born out of an oppressive ideology that demands that parents should always be interacting with their children It s based on a somewhat fantasized very white very upper middle class ideology that says if you re failing to expose your child to words you are neglecting them Tronick believes that just because a child isn t learning from the screen doesn t mean there s no value to it particularly if it gives parents time to have a shower do housework or simply have a break from their child Parents he says can get a lot out of using their devices to speak to a friend or get some work out of the way This can make them feel happier which lets then be more available to their child the rest of the time According to Jenny Radesky digital products are designed to A simplify routine matters B absorb user attention C better interpersonal relations D increase work efficiency Radesky s food testing exercise shows that mothers use of devices A takes away babies appetite B distracts children s attention C slows down babies verbal development D reduces mother child communication Radesky s cites the still face experiment to show that A it is easy for children to get used to blank expressions B verbal expressions are unnecessary for emotional exchange C children are insensitive to changes in their parents mood D parents need to respond to children s emotional needs The oppressive ideology mentioned by Tronick requires parents to A protect kids from exposure to wild fantasies B teach their kids at least words a year C ensure constant interaction with their children D remain concerned about kid s use of screens C oppressive ideology Tronick that that demands requires C constant interaction always interacting A fantasies B words if D concerned concerned According to Tronick kid s use of screens may A give their parents some free time B make their parents more creative C help them with their homework D help them become more attentive Text Today widespread social pressure to immediately go to college in conjunction with increasingly high expectations in a fast moving world often causes students to completely overlook the possibility of taking a gap year After all if everyone you know is going to college in the fall it seems silly to stay back a year doesn t it And after going to school for years it doesn t feel natural to spend a year doing something that isn t academic But while this may be true it s not a good enough reason to condemn gap years There s always a constant fear of falling behind everyone else on the socially perpetuated race to the finish line whether that be toward graduate school medical school or lucrative career But despite common misconceptions a gap year does not hinder the success of academic pursuits in fact it probably enhances it Studies from the United States and Australia show that students who take a gap year are generally better prepared for and perform better in college than those who do not Rather than pulling students back a gap year pushes them ahead by preparing them for independence new responsibilities and environmental changes all things that first year students often struggle with the most Gap year experiences can lessen the blow when it comes to adjusting to college and being thrown into a brand new environment making it easier to focus on academics and activities rather than acclimation blunders If you re not convinced of the inherent value in taking a year off to explore interests then consider its financial impact on future academic choices According to the National Center for Education Statistics nearly percent of college students end up changing their majors at least once This isn t surprising considering the basic mandatory high school curriculum leaves students with a poor understanding of themselves listing one major on their college applications but switching to another after taking college classes It s not necessarily a bad thing but depending on the school it can be costly to make up credits after switching too late in the game At Boston College for example you would have to complete an extra year were you to switch to the nursing school from another department Taking a gap year to figure things out initially can help prevent stress and save money later on One of the reasons for high school graduates not taking a gap year is that A they think it academically misleading B they have a lot of fun to expect in college C it feels strange to do differently from others D it seems worthless to take off campus courses Studies from the US and Australia imply that taking a gap year helps A keep students from being unrealistic B lower risks in choosing careers C ease freshmen s financial burdens D relieve freshmen of pressures The word acclimation Line Para is closest in meaning to A adaptation B application C motivation D competition A gap year may save money for students by helping them A avoid academic failures B establish long term goals C switch to another college D decide on the right major The most suitable title for this text would be A In Favor of the Gap Year B The ABCs of the Gap Year C The Gap Year Comes Back D The Gap Year A Dilemma Text Though often viewed as a problem for western states the growing frequency of wildfires is a national concern because of its impact on federal tax dollars says Professor Max Moritz a specialist in fire ecology and management In the US Forest Service for the first time spent more than half of its billion annual budget fighting fires nearly double the percentage it spent on such efforts years ago In effect fewer federal funds today are going towards the agency s other work such as forest conservation watershed and cultural resources management and infrastructure upkeep that affect the lives of all Americans Another nationwide concern is whether public funds from other agencies are going into construction in fire prone districts As Moritz puts it how often are federal dollars building homes that are likely to be lost to a wildfire It s already a huge problem from a public expenditure perspective for the whole country he says We need to take a magnifying glass to that Like Wait a minute is this OK Do we want instead to redirect those funds to concentrate on lower hazard parts of the landscape Such a view would require a corresponding shift in the way US society today views fire researchers say For one thing conversations about wildfires need to be more inclusive Over the past decade the focus has been on climate change how the warming of the Earth from greenhouse gases is leading to conditions that worsen fires While climate is a key element Moritz says it shouldn t come at the expense of the rest of the equation The human systems and the landscapes we live on are linked and the interactions go both ways he says Failing to recognize that he notes leads to an overly simplified view of what the solutions might be Our perception of the problem and of what the solution is becomes very limited At the same time people continue to treat fire as an event that needs to be wholly controlled and unleashed only out of necessity says Professor Balch at the University of Colorado But acknowledging fire s inevitable presence in human life is an attitude crucial to developing the laws policies and practices that make it as safe as possible she says We ve disconnected ourselves from living with fire Balch says It is really important to understand and try and tease out what is the human connection with fire today More frequent wildfires have become a national concern because in they A exhausted unprecedented management efforts B consumed a record high percentage of budget C severely damaged the ecology of western states D caused a huge rise of infrastructure expenditure Moritz calls for the use of a magnifying glass to A raise more funds for fire prone areas B avoid the redirection of federal money C find wildfire free parts of the landscape D guarantee safer spending of public funds While admitting that climate is a key element Moritz notes that A public debates have not settled yet B fire fighting conditions are improving C other factors should not be overlooked D a shift in the view of fire has taken place The overly simplified view Moritz mentions is a result of failing to A discover the fundamental makeup of nature B explore the mechanism of the human systems C maximize the role of landscape in human life D understand the interrelations of man and nature Professor Balch points out that fire is something man should A do away with B come to terms with C pay a price for D keep away from Part B Directions Read the following text and match each of

American manufacturing is a common refrain particularly from Donald Trump We don t make anything anymore he told Fox News while defending his own made in Mexico clothing line Without question manufacturing has taken a significant hit during recent decades and further trade deals raise questions about whether new shocks could hit manufacturing But there is also a different way to look at the data Across the country factory owners are now grappling with a new challenge instead of having too many workers they may end up with too few Despite trade competition and outsourcing American manufacturing still needs to replace tens of thousands of retiring boomers every years Millennials may not be that interested in taking their place other industries are recruiting them with similar or better pay For factory owners it all adds up to stiff competition for workers and upward pressure on wages They re harder to find and they have job offers says Jay Dunwell president of Wolverine Coil Spring a family owned firm They may be coming into the workforce but they ve been plucked by other industries that are also doing an well as manufacturing Mr Dunwell has begun bringing high school

about his choice of career he says at high school he considered medical school before switching to electrical engineering I love working with tools I love creating he says But to win over these young workers manufacturers have to clear another major hurdle parents who lived through the worst US economic downturn since the Great Depression telling them to avoid the factory Millennials remember

concerns aren t misplaced Employment in manufacturing has fallen from million in to million in When the recovery began worker shortages first appeared in the high skilled trades Now shortages are appearing at the mid skill levels The gap is between the jobs that take to skills and those that require a lot of skill says Rob Spohr a business professor at Montcalm Community College There re enough people to fill the jobs at McDonalds and other places where you don t need to have much skill It s that gap in between and that s where the problem is Julie Parks of Grand Rapids Community

reveals that the need to know is so strong that people will to satisfy their curiosity even when it is clear the answer will In a series of four experiments behavioral scientists at the University of Chicago and the Wisconsin School of Business tested students willingness to themselves to unpleasant stimuli in an effort to satisfy curiosity For one each participant was shown a pile of pens that the researcher claimed were from a previous experiment The twist Half of the pens would an electric shock when clicked Twenty seven students were told which pens were electrified another twenty seven were told only that some were electrified left alone in the room the students who did not know which ones would shock them clicked more pens and incurred more shocks than the students who knew what would Subsequent experiments reproduced this effect with other stimuli the sound of fingernails on a chalkboard and photographs of disgusting insects The drive to is deeply rooted in humans much the same as the basic drives for or shelter says Christopher Hsee of the University of Chicago Curiosity is often considered a good instinct it can new scientific advances for instance but sometimes such

Part A Directions Read the following four texts Answer the questions below each text by choosing A B C or D Mark your answers on ANSWER SHEET I points Text It is curious that Stephen Koziatek feels almost as though he has to justify his efforts to give his students a better future Mr Koziatek is part of something pioneering He is a teacher at a New Hampshire high school where learning is not something of books and tests and mechanical memorization but practical When did it become accepted wisdom that students should be able to name the th president of the United States but be utterly overwhelmed by a broken bike chain As Koziatek knows there is learning in just about everything Nothing is necessarily gained by forcing students to learn geometry at a graffitied desk stuck with generations of discarded chewing gum They can also learn geometry by assembling a bicycle But he s also found a kind of insidious prejudice Working with your hands is seen as almost a mark of inferiority Schools in the family of vocational education have that stereotype that it s for kids who can t make it academically he says On one hand that viewpoint is a logical product of America s evolution Manufacturing is not the economic engine that it once was The job security that the US economy once offered to high school graduates has largely evaporated More education is the new principle We want more for our kids and rightfully so But the headlong push into bachelor s degrees for all and the subtle devaluing of anything less misses an important point That s not the only thing the American economy needs Yes a bachelor s degree opens more doors But even now percent of the jobs in the country are middle skill jobs such as construction and high skill manufacturing But only percent of workers are adequately trained In other words at a time when the working class has turned the country on its political head frustrated that the opportunity that once defined America is vanishing one obvious solution is staring us in the face There is a gap in working class jobs but the workers who need those jobs most aren t equipped to do them Koziatek s Manchester School of Technology High School is trying to fill that gap Koziatek s school is a wake up call When education becomes one size fits all it risks overlooking a nation s diversity of gifts A broken bike chain is mentioned to show students lack of A mechanical memorization B academic training C practical ability D pioneering spirit There exists the prejudice that vocational education is for kids who A are financially disadvantaged B are not academically successful C have a stereotyped mind D have no career motivation We can infer from Paragraph that high school graduates A are entitled to more educational privileges B are reluctant to work in manufacturing C used to have more job opportunities D used to have big financial concerns The headlong push into bachelor s degrees for all A helps create a lot of middle skill jobs B may narrow the gap in working class jobs C is expected to yield a better trained workforce D indicates the overvaluing of higher education The author s attitude toward Koziatek s school can be described as A supportive B disappointed C tolerant D cautious Text While fossil fuels coal oil gas still generate roughly percent of the world s energy supply it s cleaner than ever that the future belongs to renewable sources such as wind and solar The move to renewables is picking up momentum around the world They now account for more than half of new power sources going on line Some growth stems from a commitment by governments and farsighted businesses to fund cleaner energy sources But increasingly the story is about the plummeting prices of renewables especially wind and solar The cost of solar panels has dropped by percent and the cost of wind turbines by close to one third in the past eight years In many parts of the world renewable energy is already a principal energy source In Scotland for example wind turbines provide enough electricity to power percent of homes While the rest of the world takes the lead notably China and Europe the United States is also seeing a remarkable shift In March for the first time wind and solar power accounted for more than percent of the power generated in the US reported the US Energy Information Administration President Trump has underlined fossil fuels especially coal as the path to economic growth In a recent speech in Iowa he dismissed wind power as an unreliable energy source But that message did not play well with many in Iowa where wind turbines dot the fields and provide percent of the state s electricity generation and where tech giants such as Facebook Microsoft and Google are being attracted by the availability of clean energy to power their data centers The question what happens when the wind doesn t blow or the sun doesn t shine has provided a quick put down for skeptics But a boost in the storage capacity of batteries is making their ability to keep power flowing around the clock more likely The advance is driven in part by vehicle manufacturers who are placing big bets on battery powered electric vehicles Although electric cars are still a rarity on roads now this massive investment could change the picture rapidly in coming years While there s a long way to go the train lines for renewables are spiking The pace of change in energy sources appears to be speeding up perhaps just in time to have a meaningful effect in slowing climate change what Washington does or doesn t do to promote alternative energy may mean less and less at a time of a global shift in thought The word plummeting Line Para is closest in meaning to A stabilizing B changing C falling D rising According to Paragraph the use of renewable energy in America A is progressing notably B is as extensive as in Europe C faces many challenges D has proved to be impractical It can be learned that in Iowa A wind is a widely used energy source B wind energy has replaced fossil fuels C tech giants are investing in clean energy D there is a shortage of clean energy supply Which of the following is true about clean energy according to paragraphs A Its application has boosted battery storage B It is commonly used in car manufacturing C Its continuous supply is becoming a reality D Its sustainable exploitation will remain difficult It can be inferred from the last paragraph that renewable energy A will bring the US closer to other countries B will accelerate global environmental change C is not really encouraged by the US government D is not competitive enough with regard to its cost Text The power and ambition of the giants of the digital economy is astonishing Amazon has just announced the purchase of the upmarket grocery chain Whole Foods for bn but two years ago Facebook paid even more than that to acquire the WhatsApp messaging service which doesn t have any physical product at all What WhatsApp offered Facebook was an intricate and finely detailed web of its users friendships and social lives Facebook promised the European commission then that it would not link phone numbers to Facebook identities but it broke the promise almost as soon as the deal went through Even without knowing what was in the messages the knowledge of who sent them and to whom was enormously revealing and still could be What political journalist what party whip would not want to know the makeup of the WhatsApp groups in which Theresa May s enemies are currently plotting It may be that the value of Whole Foods to Amazon is not so much the shops it owns but the records of which customers have purchased what Competition law appears to be the only way to address these imbalances of power But it is clumsy For one thing it is very slow compared to the pace of change within the digital economy By the time a problem has been addressed and remedied it may have vanished in the marketplace to be replaced by new abuses of power But there is a deeper conceptual problem too Competition law as presently interpreted deals with financial disadvantage to consumers and this is not obvious when the users of these services don t pay for them The users of their services are not their customers That would be the people who buy advertising from them and Facebook and Google the two virtual giants dominate digital advertising to the disadvantage of all other media and entertainment companies The product they re selling is data and we the users convert our lives to data for the benefit of the digital giants Just as some ants farm the bugs called aphids for the honeydew that produce when they feed so Google farms us for the data that our digital lives yield Ants keep predatory insects away from where their aphids feed Gmail keeps the spammers out of our inboxes It doesn t feel like a human or democratic relationship even if both sides benefit According to Paragraph Facebook acquired WhatsApp for its A digital products B user information C physical assets D quality service Linking phone numbers to Facebook identities may A worsen political disputes B mess up customer records C pose a risk to Facebook users D mislead the European commission According to the author competition law A violated the Constitution B undermined the states interests C supported the federal statute D stood in favor of the states The White House claims that its power of enforcement A they are not defined as customers B they are not financially reliable C the services are generally digital D the services are paid for by advertisers The ants analogy is used to illustrate A a win win business model between digital giants B a typical competition pattern among digital giants C the benefits provided for digital giants customers D the relationship between digital giants and their users Text To combat the trap of putting a premium on being busy Cal Newport author of Deep Work Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World recommends building a habit of deep work the ability to focus without distraction There are a number of approaches to mastering the art of deep work be it lengthy retreats dedicated to a specific task developing a daily ritual or taking a journalistic approach to seizing moments of deep work when you can throughout the day Whichever approach the key is to determine your length of focus time and stick to it Newport also recommends deep scheduling to combat constant interruptions and get more done in less time At any given point I should have deep work scheduled for roughly the next month Once on the calendar I protect this time like I would a doctor s appointment or important meeting he writes Another approach to getting more done in less time is to rethink how you prioritise your day in particular how we craft our to do lists Tim Harford author of Messy The Power of Disorder to Transform Our Lives points to a study in the early s that divided undergraduates into two groups some were advised to set out monthly goals and study activities others were told to plan activities and goals in much more detail day by day While the researchers assumed that the well structured daily plans would be most effective when it come to the execution of tasks they were wrong the detailed daily plans demotivated students Harford argues that inevitable distractions often render the daily to do list ineffective while leaving room for improvisation in such a list can reap the best results In order to make the most of our focus and energy we also need to embrace downtime or as Newport suggests be lazy Idleness is not just a vacation an indulgence or a vice it is as indispensable to the brain as vitamin D is to the body idleness is paradoxically necessary to getting any work done he argues Srini Pillay an assistant professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School believes this counterintuitive link between downtime and productivity may be due to the way our brains operate When our brains switch between being focused and unfocused on a task they tend to be more efficient What people don t realise is that in order to complete these tasks they need to use both the focus and unfocus circuits in their brain says Pillay The key to mastering the art of deep work is to A seize every minute to work B list you immediate tasks C make specific daily plans D keep to your focus time The study in the early s cited by Harford shows that A students are hardly motivated by monthly goals B detailed plans may not be as fruitful as expected C distractions may actually increase efficiency D daily schedules arc indispensable to studying According to Newport idleness is A a desirable mental state for busy people B a major contributor to physical health C an effective way to save time and energy D an essential factor in accomplishing any work Pillay believes that our brain s shift between being focused and unfocused A can bring about greater efficiency B can result in psychological well being C is driven by task urgency D is aimed at better balance in work This text is mainly about A approaches to getting more done in less time B Ways to relieve the tension of busy life C The key to eliminating distractions D The cause of the lack of focus time Part B Directions Read the following text and

links which means when you have a conversation with a new person a link gets formed and every conversation you have after that moment will strengthen the link You meet new people every day the grocery worker the cab driver new people at work or the security guard at the door Simply starting a conversation with them will form a link Here are five simple ways that you can make the first move and start a conversation with strangers Suppose you are in a room with someone you don t know and something within you says I want to talk with this person this is something that mostly happens with all of us You wanted to say something the first word but it just won t come out It feels like it is stuck somewhere I know the feeling and here is my advice just get it out Just think that is the worst that could happen They won t talk with you Well they are not talking with you now I truly believe that once you get that first word out everything else will just flow So keep it simple Hi Hey or Hello do the best you can to gather all of the enthusiasm and energy you can put on a big smile and say Hi It s a problem all of us face you have limited time with the person that you want to talk with and you want to make this talk memorable Honestly if we got stuck in the rut of hi hello how are you and what s going on you will fail to give the initial jolt to the conversation that can make it so memorable So don t be afraid to ask more personal questions Trust me you ll be surprised to see how much people are willing to share if you just ask When you meet a person for the first time make an effort to find the things which you and that person have in common so that you can build the conversation from that point When you start conversation from there and then move outwards you ll find all of a sudden that the conversation becomes a lot easier Imagine you are pouring your heart out to someone and they are just busy on their phone and if you ask for their attention you get the response I can multitask So when someone tries to communicate with you just be in that communication wholeheartedly Make eye contact you can feel the conversation You all came into a conversation where you first met the person but after some time you may have met again and have forgotten their name Isn t that awkward So remember the little details of the people you met or you talked with perhaps the places they have been to the place they want to go the things they like the thing the hate whatever you talk about When you remember such thing you can automatically become investor in their wellbeing So they feel a responsibility to you to keep that relationship going That s it Five amazing ways that you can make conversation with almost anyone Every person is a really good book to read or to have a

weight fluctuations when done too often this habit can sometimes hurt more than it As for me weighing myself every day caused me to shift my focus from being generally healthy and physically active to focusing on the scale That was bad to my overall fitness goals I had gained weight in the form of muscle mass but thinking only of the number on the scale I altered my training program That conflicted with how I needed to train to my goals I also found weighing myself daily did not provide an accurate of the hard work and progress I was making in the gym It takes about three weeks to a month to notice significant changes in weight altering your training program The most changes will be observed in skill level strength and inches lost For these I stopped weighing myself every day and switched to a bimonthly weighing schedule Since weight loss is not my goal it is less important for me to my weigh each week Weighing every other week allows me to observe and any significant weight changes That tells me whether I need to my training program I also use my bimonthly weigh in to get information about my nutrition as well If my training intensity remains the same but I m constantly and dropping weight this is a that I need to increase my daily caloric intake The to stop weighing myself every day has done wonders for my overall health fitness and well being I am experiencing increased zeal for working out since I no longer carry the burden of a morning weigh in I ve also experienced greater success in achieving my specific fitness goals I m training according to those

Reading Comprehension Part A Directions Read the following four texts Answer the questions below each text by choosing A B C or D Mark your answers on the ANSWER SHEET points Text Unlike so called basic emotions such as sadness fear and anger guilt emerges a little later in conjunction with a child s growing grasp of social and moral norms Children aren t born knowing how to say I m sorry rather they learn over time that such statements appease parents and friends and their own consciences This is why researchers generally regard so called moral guilt in the right amount to be a good thing In the popular imagination of course guilt still gets a bad rap It is deeply uncomfortable it s the emotional equivalent of wearing a jacket weighted with stones Yet this understanding is outdated There has been a kind of revival or a rethinking about what guilt is and what role guilt can serve says Amrisha Vaish a psychology researcher at the University of Virginia adding that this revival is part of a larger recognition that emotions aren t binary feelings that may be advantageous in one context may be harmful in another Jealousy and anger for example may have evolved to alert us to important inequalities Too much happiness think mania can be destructive And guilt by prompting us to think more deeply about our goodness can encourage humans to make up for errors and fix relationships Guilt in other words can help hold a cooperative species together It is a kind of social glue Viewed in this light guilt is an opportunity Work by Tina Malti a psychology professor at the University of Toronto suggests that guilt may compensate for an emotional deficiency In a number of studies Malti and others have shown that guilt and sympathy may represent different pathways to cooperation and sharing Some kids who are low in sympathy may make up for that shortfall by experiencing more guilt which can rein in their nastier impulses And vice versa High sympathy can substitute for low guilt In a study for example Malti looked at children Using caregiver assessments and the children s self observations she rated each child s overall sympathy level and his or her tendency to feel negative emotions after moral transgressions Then the kids were handed chocolate coins and given a chance to share them with an anonymous child For the low sympathy kids how much they shared appeared to turn on how inclined they were to feel guilty The guilt prone ones shared more even though they hadn t magically become more sympathetic to the other child s deprivation That s good news Malti says We can be prosocial because we caused harm and we feel regret Researchers think that guilt can be a good thing because it may help A regulate a child s basic emotions B improve a child s intellectual ability C intensify a child s positive feelings D foster a child s moral development According to Paragraph many people still consider guilt to be A deceptive B addictive C burdensome Dinexcusable Vaish holds that the rethinking about guilt comes from an awareness that A an emotion can play opposing roles B emotions are socially constructive C emotional stability can benefit health D emotions are context independent Malti and others have shown that cooperation and sharing A may help correct emotional deficiencies B can bring about emotional satisfaction C can result from either sympathy or guilt D may be the outcome of impulsive acts The word transgressions line Para is closest in meaning to A wrongdoings B discussions C restrictions D teachings Text Forests give us shade quiet and one of the harder challenges in the fight against climate change Even as we humans count on forests to soak up a good share of the carbon dioxide we produce we are threatening their ability to do so The climate change we are hastening could one day leave us with forests that emit more carbon than they absorb Thankfully there is a way out of this trap but it involves striking a subtle balance Helping forests flourish as valuable carbon sinks long into the future may require reducing their capacity to absorb carbon now California is leading the way as it does on so many climate efforts in figuring out the details The state s proposed Forest Carbon Plan aims to double efforts to thin out young trees and clear brush in parts of the forest This temporarily lowers carbon carrying capacity But the remaining trees draw a greater share of the available moisture so they grow and thrive restoring the forest s capacity to pull carbon from the air Healthy trees are also better able to fend off insects The landscape is rendered less easily burnable Even in the event of a fire fewer trees are consumed The need for such planning is increasingly urgent Already since drought and insects have killed more than million trees in California most of them in alone and wildfires have burned hundreds of thousands of acres California s plan to treat acres of forest a year by and by financed from the proceeds of the state s emissions permit auctions That s only a small share of the total acreage that could benefit about half a million acres in all so it will be vital to prioritize areas at greatest risk of fire or drought The strategy also aims to ensure that carbon in woody material removed from the forests is locked away in the form of solid lumber or burned as biofuel in vehicles that would otherwise run on fossil fuels New research on transportation biofuels is under way State governments are well accustomed to managing forests but traditionally they ve focused on wildlife watersheds and opportunities for recreation Only recently have they come to see the vital part forests will have to play in storing carbon California s plan which is expected to be finalized by the governor next year should serve as a model By saying one of the harder challenges the author implies that A forests may become a potential threat B people may misunderstand global warming C extreme weather conditions may arise D global climate change may get out of control To maintain forests as valuable carbon sinks we may need to A lower their present carton absorbing capacity B accelerate the growth of young trees C strike a balance among different plants D preserve the diversity of species in them California s Forest Carbon Plan endeavors to A cultivate more drought resistant trees B find more effective ways to kill insects C reduce the density of some of its forests D restore its forests quickly after wildfires What is essential to California s plan according to Paragraph A To carry it out before the year of B To handle the areas in serious danger first C To perfect the emissions permit auctions D To obtain enough financial support The author s attitude to California s plan can be best be described as A ambiguous B tolerant C cautious D suportive Text American farmers have been complaining of labor shortages for several years The complaints are unlikely to stop without an overhaul of immigration rules for farm workers Congress has obstructed efforts to create a more straightforward visa for agricultural workers that would let foreign workers stay longer in the U S and change jobs within the industry If this doesn t change American businesses communities and consumers will be the losers Perhaps half of U S farm laborers are undocumented immigrants As fewer such workers enter the country the characteristics of the agricultural workforce are changing Today s farm laborers while still predominantly born in Mexico are more likely to be settled rather than migrating and more likely to be married than single They are also aging At the start of this century about one third of crop workers were over the age of Now more than half are And picking crops is hard on older bodies One oft debated cure for this labor shortage remains as implausible as it s been all along Native U S workers won t be returning to the farm Mechanization isn t the answer either not yet at least Production of corn cotton rice soybeans and wheat has been largely mechanized but many high value labor intensive crops such as strawberries need labor Even dairy farms where robots do a small share of milking have a long way to go before they are automated As a result farms have grown increasingly reliant on temporary guest workers using the H A visa to fill the gaps in the agricultural workforce Starting around requests for the visas rose sharply from to the number of visas issued more than doubled The H A visa has no numerical cap unlike the H B visa for nonagricultural work which is limited to a year Even so employers complain that they aren t given all the workers they need The process is cumbersome expensive and unreliable One survey found that bureaucratic delays led the average H A workers to arrive on the job days late The shortage is compounded by federal immigration raids which remove some workers and drive others underground In a survey percent of tree fruit growers and almost percent of raisin and berry growers said they were short of labor Some western growers have responded by moving operations to Mexico From to percent of the fruit Americans consumed was imported Little more than a decade later the share of imports was percent In effect the U S can import food or it can import the workers who pick it

rules for farm workers D Decline of job opportunities in U S agriculture One trouble with U S agricultural workforce is A the rising number of illegal immigrants B the high mobility of crop workers C the lack of experienced laborers D the aging of immigrant farm workers What is the much argued solution to the labor shortage in U S farming A To attract younger laborers to farm work B To get native

celebrities starring in a new video for World Environment Day encouraging you the consumer to swap out your single use plastic staples to combat the plastics crisis The key messages that have been put together for World Environment Day do include a call for governments to enact legislation to curb single use plastics But the overarching message is directed at individuals My concern with leaving it up to the individual however is our limited sense of what needs to be achieved On their own taking our own bags to the grocery store or quitting plastic straws for example will accomplish little and require very little of us They could even be harmful satisfying a need to have done our bit without ever progressing onto bigger bolder more effective actions a kind of moral licensing that eases our concerns and stops us doing more and asking more of those in charge While the conversation around our environment and our responsibility toward it remains centered on shopping bags and straws we re ignoring the balance of power that implies that as consumers we must shop sustainably rather than as citizens hold our governments and industries to account to push for real systemic change It s important to acknowledge that the environment isn t everyone s priority or even most people s We shouldn t expect it to be In her latest book Why Good People Do Bad Environmental Things Elizabeth R DeSombre argues that the best way to collectively change the behavior of large numbers of people is for the change to be structural This might mean implementing policy such as a plastic tax that adds a cost to environmentally problematic action or banning single use plastics altogether India has just announced it will eliminate all single use plastic in the country by There are also incentive based ways of making better environmental choices easier such as ensuring recycling is at least as easy as trash disposal DeSombre isn t saying people should stop caring about the environment It s just that individual actions are too slow she says for that to be the only or even primary approach to changing widespread behavior None of this is about writing off the individual It s just about putting things into perspective We don t have time to wait We need progressive policies that shape collective action alongside engaged citizens pushing for change Some celebrities star in a new video to A demand new laws on the use of plastics B urge consumers to cut the use of plastics C invite public opinion on the plastics crisis D disclose the causes of the plastics crisis The author is concerned that moral licensing may A mislead us into doing worthless things B prevent us from making further efforts C weaken our sense of accomplishment D suppress our desire for success By pointing out our identity as citizens the author indicates that A our focus should be shifted to community welfare B our relationship with local industries is improving C we have been actively exercising our civil rights D we should press our governments to lead the combat DeSombre argues that the best way for a collective change should be A a win win arrangement B a self driven mechanism C a cost

backyard McClain s little ones aren t the only kids who have an opinion when it comes to housing and in many cases youngsters views weigh heavily on parents real estate decisions according to a Harris Poll survey of more than U S adults While more families buck an older generation proclivity to leave kids in the dark about real estate decisions realty agents and psychologists have mixed views about the financial personal and long term effects kids opinions may have The idea of involving children in a big decision is a great idea because it can help them feel a sense of control and ownership in what can be an overwhelming process said Ryan Hooper a clinical psychologist in Chicago Children may face serious difficulties in coping with significant moves especially if it removes them from their current school or support system he said Greg Jaroszewski a real estate broker with Gagliardo Realty Associates said he s not convinced that kids should be involved in selecting a home but their opinions should be considered in regards to proximity to friends and social activities if possible Younger children should feel like they re choosing their home without actually getting a choice in the matter said Adam Leitman Bailey a real estate attorney based in New York Asking them questions about what they like about the backyard of a potential home will make them feel like they re being included in the decision making process Bailey said Many of the aspects of homebuying aren t a consideration for children said Tracey Hampson a real estate agent based in Santa Clarita Calif And placing too much emphasis on their opinions can ruin a fantastic home purchase Speaking with your children before you make a real estate decision is wise but I wouldn t base the purchasing decision solely on their opinions Hampson said The other issue is that many children especially older ones may base their real estate knowledge on HGTV shows said Aaron Norris of The Norris Group in Riverside Calif They love Chip and Joanna Gaines just as much as the rest of us he said HGTV has seriously changed how people view real estate It s not shelter it s a lifestyle With that mindset change come some serious money consequences Kids tend to get stuck in the features and the immediate benefits to them personally Norris said Parents need to remind their children that their needs and desires may change over time said Julie Gurner a real estate analyst with FitSmallBusiness com Their opinions can change tomorrow Gurner said Harsh as it may be to say that decision should likely not be made contingent on a child s opinions but rather made for them with great consideration into what home can meet their needs best and give them an opportunity to customize it a bit and make it their own

answers on the ANSWER SHEET points Text Rats and other animals need to be highly at tuned to social signals from others so that can identify friends to cooperate with and enemies to avoid To find out if this extends to non living beings Loleh Quinn at the University of California San Diego and her colleagues tested whether rats can detect social signals form robotic rats They housed eight adult rats with two types of robotic rat one social and one asocial for our days The robots rats were quite minimalist resembling a chunkier version of a computer mouse with wheels to move around and colorful markings During the experiment the social robot rat followed the living rats around played with the same toys and opened caged doors to let trapped rats escape Meanwhile the asocial robot simply moved forwards and backwards and side to side Next the researchers trapped the robots in cages and gave the rats the opportunity to release them by pressing a lever Across trials each the living rats were percent more likely on average to set the social robot free than the asocial one This suggests that the rats perceived the social robot as a genuine social being They may have bonded more with the social robot because it displayed behaviours like communal exploring and playing This could lead to the rats better remembering having freed it earlier and wanting the robot to return the favour when they get trapped says Quinn The readiness of the rats to befriend the social robot was surprising given its minimal design The robot was the same size as a regular rat but resembled a simple plastic box on wheels We d assumed we d have to give it a moving head and tail facial features and put a scene on it to make it smell like a real rat but that wasn t necessary says Janet Wiles at the University of Queensland in Australia who helped with the research The finding shows how sensitive rats are to social cues even when they come from basic robots Similarly children tend to treat robots as if they are fellow beings even when they display only simple social signals We humans seem to be fascinated by robots and it turns out other animals are too says Wiles Quin and her colleagues conducted a test to see if rats can A pickup social signals from non living rats B distinguish a friendly rat from a hostile one C attain sociable traits through special training D send out warning messages to their fellow What did the social robot do during the experiment A It followed the social robot B It played with some toys C It set the trapped rats free D It moved around alone According to Quinn the rats released the social robot because they A tried to practice a means of escape B expected it to do the same in return C wanted to display their intelligence D considered that an interesting game James Wiles notes that rats A can remember other rat s facial features B differentiate smells better than sizes C respond more to cations than to looks D can be scared by a plastic box on wheels It can be learned from the text that rats A appear to be adaptable to new surroundings B are more socially active than other animals C behave differently from children in socializing D are more sensitive to social cues than expectedText It is true that CEO pay has gone up top ones may make times the pay of typical workers on average and since the mid s CEO pay for large publicly traded American corporations has by varying estimates gone up by about The typical CEO of a top American corporation now makes about S million a year The best model for understanding the growth of CEO pay is that of limited CEO talent in a world where business opportunities for the top firms are growing rapidly The efforts of America s highest earning have been one of the more dynamic elements of the global economy It s not popular to say but one reason their pay has gone up so much is that CEOs really have upped their game relative to many other workers in the U S economy Today s CEO at least for major American firms must have many mere skills than simply being able to run the company CEOs must have a good sense of financial markets and maybe even how the company should trade in them They also need better public relations skills than their predecessors as the costs of even a minor slipup can be significant Then there s the fact that large American companies are much more globalized than ever before with supply chains spread across a larger number of countries To lead in that system requires knowledge that is farly mind boggling plus virtually all major American companies are beyond this major CEOs still have to do all the day to day work they have always done The common idea that high CEO pay is mainly about ripping people off doesn t explain history very well By most measures corporate governmance has become a lot tighter and more rigorous since the s Yet it is principally during this period of stronger govemnance that CEO pay has been high and rising That suggests it is in the broader corporate interest to recruit top candidates for increasingly tough jobs Furthermore the highest CEO salaries are paid to outside candidates not to the cozy insider picks another sign that high CEO pay is not some kind of depredation at the expense of the rest of the company And the stock market reacts positively when companies tie CEO pay to say stock prices a sign that those practices build up corporate value not just for the CEO Which of the following has contributed to CEO pay rise A The growth in the number of corporations B The general pay rise with a better economy C Increased business opportunities for top firms D Close cooperation among leading economies Compared with their predecessors today s CEOs are required to A foster a stronger sense of teamwork B finance more research and development C establish closer ties with tech companies D operate more globalized companies CEO pay has been rising since the s despite A continual internal opposition B strict corporate governance C conservative business strategies D Repeated government warnings High CEO pay can be justified by the fact that it helps A confirm the status of CEOs B motivate inside candidates C boost the efficiency of CEOs D increase corporate value The most suitable title for this text would be A CEOs Are Not Overpaid B CEO Pay Past and Present C CEOs challenges of Today D CEO Traits Not Easy to Define Text Madrid was hailed as a public health beacon last November when it rolled out ambitious restrictions on the most polluting cars Seven months and one election day later a new conservative city council suspended enforcement of the clean air zone a first step toward its possible demise Mayor Jose Luis Martinez Almeida made opposition to the zone a centrepiece of his election campaign despite its success in improving air quality A judge has now overruled the city s decision to stop levying fines ordering them reinstated But with legal battles ahead the zone s future looks uncertain at best Among other weaknesses the measures cities must employ when left to tackle dirty air on their own are politically contentious and therefore vulnerable That s because they inevitably put the costs of cleaning the air on to individual drivers who must pay fees or buy better vehicles rather than on to the car manufacturers whose cheating is the real cause of our toxic pollution It s not hard to imagine a similar reversal happening in London The new ultra low emission zone Ulez is likely to be a big issue in next year s mayoral election And if Sadiq Khan wins and extends it to the North and South Circular roads in as he intends it is sure to spark intense opposition from the far larger number of motorists who will then be affected It s not that measures such as London s Ulez are useless Far from it Local officials are using the levers that are available to them to safeguard residents health in the face of a serious threat The zones do deliver some improvements to air quality and the science tells us that means real health benefits fewer heart attacks strokes and premature births less cancer dementia and asthma Fewer untimely deaths But mayors and councillors can only do so much about a problem that is far bigger than any one city or town They are acting because national governments Britain s and others across Europe have failed to do so Restrictions that keep highly polluting cars out of certain areas city centres school streets even individual roads are a response to the absence of a larger effort to properly enforce existing regulations and require auto companies to bring their vehicles into compliance Wales has introduced special low speed limits to minimise pollution We re doing everything but insist that manufacturers clean up their cars Which of the following is true about Madrid s clean air zone A Its effects are questionable B It has been opposed by a judge C It needs tougher enforcement D Its fate is yet to be decided Which is considered a weakness of the city level measures to tackle dirty air A They are biased against car manufacturers B They prove impractical for city councils C They are deemed too mild for politicians D They put too much burden on individual motorists The author believes that the extension of London s Ulez will A arouse strong resistance B ensure Khan s electoral success C improve the city s traffic D discourage car manufacturing Who does the author think should have addressed the problem A Local residents B Mayors C Councilors D National governments It can be inferred from the last paragraph that auto companies A will raise low emission car production B should be forced to follow regulations C will upgrade the design of their vehicles D should be put under public supervisionText Now that members of Generation Z are graduating college this spring the most commonly accepted definition says this generation was born after give or take a year the attention

Is it possible to like everyone in your office Think about how tough it is to get together people much less who all get along perfectly But unlike in friendships you need coworkers You work with them every day and you depend on them just as they depend on you Here are some ways that you can get the whole office on your side If you have a bone to pick with someone in your workplace you may try stay tight lipped around them But you won t be helping either one of you A Harvard Business School study found that observers consistently rated those who were frank about themselves more highly while those who hid lost trustworthiness The lesson is not that you should make your personal life an open book but rather when given the option to offer up details about yourself or painstakingly conceal them you should just be honest Just as important as being honest about yourself is being receptive to others We often feel the need to tell others how we feel whether it s a concern about a project a stray thought or a compliment Those are all valid but you need to take time to hear out your coworkers too In fact rushing to get your own ideas out there can cause colleagues to feel you don t value their opinions Do your best to engage coworkers in a genuine back and forth conversation rather than prioritizing your own thoughts It s common to have a cubicle mate or special confidant in a work setting But in addition to those trusted coworkers you should expand your horizons and find out about all the people around you Use your lunch and coffee breaks to meet up with colleagues you don t always see Find out about their lives and interests beyond the job It requires minimal effort and goes a long way This will help to gTow your internal network in addition to being a nice break in the work day Positive feedback is important for anyone to hear And you don t have to be someone s boss to tell them they did an exceptional job on a particular project This will help engender good will in others But don t overdo it or be fake about it One study found that people responded best to comments that shifted from negative to positive possibly because it suggested they had won somebody over This one may be a bit more difficult to pull off but it can go a long way to achieving results Remember in dealing with any coworker what they appreciate from an interaction Watch out for how they verbalize with others Some people like small talk in a meeting before digging into important matters while other are more straightforward Jokes that work one person won t necessarily land with another So adapt your style accordingly to type Consider the person that you re dealing with in advance and what will get you to your desired outcome Section III Translation It s almost impossible to go through life without experiencing some kind of failure But the wonderful thing about failure is that it s entirely up to us to decide how to look at it We can choose to see failure as the end of the world Or we can look at failure as the incredible learning experience that it often is Every time we fail at something we can choose to look for the lesson we re meant to learn These lessons are very important they re how we grow and how we keep from making that same mistake again Failures stop us only if we let them Failure can also teach us things about ourselves that we would never have learned otherwise For instance failure can help you discover how strong a person you are Failing at something can help you discover your truest friends or help you find unexpected motivation to succeed

Because the target is People complained that buses were late and infrequent the number of buses and bus lanes were increased and drivers were or punished according to the time they took And drivers hit these targets But they hit cyclists If the target was changed to you would have more inspectors and more sensitive pricing If the criterion changed to safety you would get more drivers who obeyed

Text Reskilling is something that sounds like a buzzword but is actually a requirement if we plan to have a future where a lot of would be workers do not get left behind We know we are moving into a period where the jobs in demand will change rapidly as will the requirements of the jobs that remain Research by the WEF detailed in the Harvard Business Review finds that on average percent of the core skills within job roles will change by That is a very short timeline so we can only imagine what the changes will be further in the future The question of who should pay for reskilling is a thorny one For individual companies the temptation is always to let go of workers whose skills are no longer in demand and replace them with those whose skills are That does not always happen AT T is often given as the gold standard of a company who decided to do a massive reskilling program rather than go with a fire and hire strategy Other companies had also pledged to create their own plans When the skills mismatch is in the broader economy Though the focus usually tums to government to handle Efforts in Canada and elsewhere have been arguably languid at best And have given us a situation where we frequently hear of employers begging for workers Even at times and in regions where unemployment is high With the pandemic unemployment is very high indeed In February at per cent and P C respectively unemployment rates in Canada and the United States were at generational lows and worker shortages were everywhere As of May those rates had spiked up to per cent and per cent and although many worker shortages had disappeared not all had done so In Born to win the medical field to take an obvious example the pandemic meant that there were still clean shortages of doctors nurses and other medical personnel Of course it is not like you can take an unemployed waiter and train him to be a doctor in a few weeks no matter who pays for it But even if you cannot close the gap maybe you can close others and doing so would be to the benefit of all concern That seems to be the case in Sweden when forced to furlough PC of their cabin staff Scandinavian Airline decided to start

predicted to hit close to billion by and forecasts that agricultural production in some regions will need to nearly double to keep pace food security is increasingly making headlines In the UK it has become a big talking point recently too for a rather particular reason Brexit Brexit is seen by some as an opportunity to reverse a recent trend towards the UK importing food The country produces only about per cent of the food it eats down from almost three quarters in the late s A move back to self sufficiency the argument goes would boost the farming industry political sovereignty and even the nation s health Sounds great but how feasible is this vision According to a report on UK food production from the University of Leeds UK per cent of the country s total land area is associated with meat and dairy production That supplies per cent of what is consumed so even covering the whole country in livestock farms wouldn t allow us to cover all our meat and dairy needs There are many caveats to those figures but they are still grave To become much more self sufficient the UK would need to drastically reduce its consumption of animal foods and probably also farm more intensively meaning fewer green fields and more factory style production But switching to a mainly plant based diet wouldn t help There is a good reason why the UK is dominated by animal husbandry most of its terrain doesn t have the right soil or climate to grow crops on a commercial basis Just per cent of the country s land is suitable for crop growing most of which is already occupied by arable fields Even if we converted all the suitable land to fields of fruit and veg which would involve taking out all the nature reserves and removing Born to win thousands of people from their homes we would achieve only a per cent boost in crop production Just per cent of the fruit and vegetables consumed in the UK are currently home grown so even with the most extreme measures we could meet only per cent of our fresh produce needs That is before we look for the space to grow the grains sugars seeds and oils that provide us with the vast bulk of our current calorie intake Some people argue that food self sufficiency in the UK would A be hindered by its population growth B contribute to the nation s well being C become a priority of the government D pose a challenge to its farming industry The report by the University of Leeds shows that in the UK A farmland has been inefficiently utilized B factory style production needs reforming C most land is used for meat and dairy production D more green fields will be converted for farming Crop growing in the UK is restricted due to A its farming technology B its dietary tradition C its natural conditions D its commercial interests It can be learned from the last paragraph that British people A rely largely on imports for fresh produce B enjoy a steady rise in fruit consumption C are seeking effective ways to cut calorie intake D are trying to grow new varieties of grains The author s attitude to food self sufficiency in the UK is A defensive B doubtful Born to win C tolerant D optimistic Text When Microsoft bought task management app Wunderlist and mobile calendar Sunrise in it picked two newcomers that were attracting considerable buzz in Silicon Valley Microsoft s own Office dominates the market for productivity software but the start ups represented a new wave of technology designed from the ground up for the smartphone world Both apps however were later scrapped after Microsoft said it had used their best features in its own products Their teams of engineers stayed on making them two of the many acqui hires that the biggest companies have used to feed their great hunger for tech talent To Microsoft s critics the fates of Wunderlist and Sunrise are examples of a remorseless drive by Big Tech to chew up any innovative companies that lie in their path They bought the seedlings and closed them down complained Paul Arnold a partner at San Francisco based Switch Ventures putting an end to businesses that might one day turn into competitors Microsoft declined to comment Like other start up investors Mr Arnold s own business often depends on selling start ups to larger tech companies though he admits to mixed feelings about the result I think these things are good for me if I put my selfish hat on But are they good for the American economy I don t know The US Federal Trade Commission says it wants to find the answer to that question This week it asked the five most valuable US tech companies for information about their many small acquisitions over the past decade Although only a rescarch project at this stage the request has raised the prospect of regulators wading into early stage tech markets that until now have been beyond their reach Given their combined market value of more than trillion rifling through such small Deals many of them much less prominent than Wunderlist and Sunrise might seem beside the point Between them the five biggest tech companies have spent an average of only billion a year on sub billion acquisitions over the past five years a drop in the ocean compared with their massive financial reserves and the more than billion of venture Born to win capital that was invested in the Us last year However critics say the big companies use such deals to buy their most threatening potential competitors before their businesses have a chance to gain momentum in some cases as part of a buy and kill tactic to simply close them down What is true about Wunderlist and Sunrise after their acquisitions A Their engineers were retained B Their market values declined C Their tech features improved D Their products were re priced Microsoft s critics believe that the big tech companies tend to A exaggerate their product quality B eliminate their potential competitors C treat new tech talent unfairly D ignore public opinions Paul Arnold is concerned that small acquisitions might A weaken big tech companies B worsen market competition C harm the national economy D discourage start up investors The US Federal Trade Commission intends to A

impressions thin slices of experience ranging from a glimpse of a photo to a five minute interaction and deliberation can be not only extraneous but intrusive In one study of the ability she called thin slicing the late psychologist Nalini Ambady asked participants to watch silent second video clips of professors and to rate the instructor s overall effectiveness Their ratings correlated strongly with students end of semester ratings Another set of participants had to count backward from by nines as they watched the clips occupying their conscious working memory Their ratings were just as accurate demonstrating the intuitive nature of the social processing Critically another group was asked to spend a minute writing down reasons for their judgment before giving the rating Accuracy dropped dramatically Ambady suspected that deliberation focused them on vivid but misleading cues such as certain gestures or utterances rather than letting the complex interplay of subtle signals form a holistic impression She found similar interference when participants watched second clips of pairs of people and judged whether they were strangers friends or dating partners Other research shows we re better at detecting deception from thin slices when we rely on intuition instead of reflection It s as if you re driving a stick shit says Judith Hall a psychologist at Northeastern University and if you start thinking about it too much you can t remember what you re doing But if you go on automatic pilot you re fine Much of our social life is like that Thinking too much can also harm our ability to form preferences College students ratings of strawberry jams and college courses aligned better with experts opinions when the students weren t asked to analyze their rationale And people made car buying decisions that were both objectively better and more personally satisfying when asked to focus on their feelings rather than on details but only if the decision was complex when they had a lot of information to process Intuition s special powers are unleashed only in certain circumstances In one study participants completed a battery of eight tasks including
