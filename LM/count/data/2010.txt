ANSWER SHEET points Text The longest bull run in a century of art market history ended on a dramatic note with a sale of works by Damien Hirst Beautiful Inside My Head Forever at Sotheby s in London on September th All but two pieces sold fetching more than m a record for a sale by a single artist It was a last victory As the auctioneer called out bids in New York one of the oldest banks on Wall Street Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy The world art market had already been losing momentum for a while after rising bewilderingly since At its peak in it was worth some billion reckons Clare McAndrew founder of Arts Economics a research firm double the figure five years earlier Since then it may have come down to billion But the market generates interest far beyond its size because it brings together great wealth enormous egos greed passion and controversy in a way matched by few other industries In the weeks and months that followed Mr Hirst s sale spending of any sort became deeply unfashionable especially in New York where the bail out of the banks coincided with the loss of thousands of jobs and the financial demise of many art buying investors In the art world that meant collectors stayed away from galleries and salerooms Sales of contemporary art fell by two thirds and in the most overheated sector they were down by nearly in the year to November Within weeks the world s two biggest auction houses Sotheby s and Christie s had to pay out nearly m in guarantees to clients who had placed works for sale with them The current downturn in the art market is the worst since the Japanese stopped buying Impressionists at the end of This time experts reckon that prices are about down on their peak on average though some have been far more fluctuant But Edward Dolman Christie s chief executive says I m pretty confident we re at the bottom What makes this slump different from the last he says is that there are still buyers in the market Almost everyone who was interviewed for this special report said that the biggest problem at the moment is not a lack of demand but a lack of good work to sell The three Ds death debt and divorce still deliver works of art to the market But anyone who does not have to sell is keeping away waiting for confidence to return In the first paragraph Damien Hirst s sale was referred to as a last victory because A the art market had witnessed a succession of victories B the auctioneer finally got the two pieces at the highest bids C Beautiful Inside My Head Forever won over all masterpieces D it was successfully made just before the world financial crisis By saying spending of any sort became deeply unfashionable Line Para the author suggests that A collectors were no longer actively involved in art market auctions B people stopped every kind of spending and stayed away from galleries C art collection as a fashion had lost its appeal to a great extent D works of art in general had gone out of fashion so they were not worth buying Which of the following statements is NOT true A Sales of contemporary art fell dramatically from to B The art market surpassed many other industries in momentum C The art market generally went downward in various ways D Some art dealers were awaiting better chances to come The three Ds mentioned in the last paragraph are A auction houses favorites B contemporary trends C factors promoting artwork circulation D styles representing impressionists The most appropriate title for this text could be A Fluctuation of Art Prices B Up to date Art Auctions C Art Market in Decline D Shifted Interest in Arts Text I was addressing a small gathering in a suburban Virginia living room a women s group that had invited men to join them Throughout the evening one man had been particularly talkative frequently offering ideas and anecdotes while his wife sat silently beside him on the couch Toward the end of the evening I commented that women frequently complain that their husbands don t talk to them This man quickly nodded in agreement He gestured toward his wife and said She s the talker in our family The room burst into laughter the man looked puzzled and hurt It s true he explained When I come home from work I have nothing to say If she didn t keep the conversation going we d spend the whole evening in silence This episode crystallizes the irony that although American men tend to talk more than women in public situations they often talk less at home And this pattern is wreaking havoc with marriage The pattern was observed by political scientist Andrew Hacker in the late s Sociologist Catherine Kohler Riessman reports in her new book Divorce Talk that most of the women she interviewed but only a few of the men gave lack of communication as the reason for their divorces Given the current divorce rate of nearly percent that amounts to millions of cases in the United States every year a virtual epidemic of failed conversation In my own research complaints from women about their husbands most often focused not on tangible inequities such as having given up the chance for a career to accompany a husband to his or doing far more than their share of daily life support work like cleaning cooking and social arrangements Instead they focused on communication He doesn t listen to me He doesn t talk to me I found as Hacker observed years before that most wives want their husbands to be first and foremost conversational partners but few husbands share this expectation of their wives In short the image that best represents the current crisis is the stereotypical cartoon scene of a man sitting at the breakfast table with a newspaper held up in front of his face while a woman glares at the back of it wanting to talk What is most wives main expectation of their husbands A Talking to them B Trusting them C Supporting their careers D Sharing housework Judging from the context the phrase wreaking havoc Line Para most probably means A generating motivation B exerting influence C causing damage D creating pressure All of the following are true EXCEPT A men tend to talk more in public than women B nearly percent of recent divorces are caused by failed conversation C women attach much importance to communication between couples D a female tends to be more talkative at home than her spouse Which of the following can best summarize the main idea of this text A The moral decaying deserves more research by sociologists B Marriage break up stems from sex inequalities C Husband and wife have different expectations from their marriage D Conversational patterns between man and wife are different In the following part immediately after this text the author will most probably focus on A a vivid account of the new book Divorce Talk B a detailed description of the stereotypical cartoon C other possible reasons for a high divorce rate in the U S D a brief introduction to the political scientist Andrew Hacker Text Over the past decade many companies had perfected the art of creating automatic behavior habits among consumers These habits have helped companies earn billions of dollars when customers eat snacks or wipe counters almost without thinking often in response to a carefully designed set of daily cues There are fundamental public health problems like dirty hands instead of a soap habit that remain killers only because we can t figure out how to change people s habits Dr Curtis said the director of the Hygiene Center at the London School of Hygiene Tropical Medicine We wanted to learn from private industry how to create new behaviors that happens automatically The companies that Dr Curtis turned to Procter Gamble Colgate Palmolive and Unilever had invested hundreds of millions of dollars finding the subtle cues in consumers lives that corporations could use to introduce new routines If you look hard enough you ll find that many of the products we use every day chewing gums skin moisturizers disinfecting wipes air fresheners water purifiers health snacks antiperspirants colognes teeth whiteners fabric softeners vitamins are results of manufactured habits A century ago few people regularly brushed their teeth multiple times a day Today because of shrewd advertising and public health campaigns many Americans habitually give their pearly whites a cavity preventing scrub twice a day often with Colgate Crest or one of the other brands A few decades ago many people didn t drink water outside of a meal Then beverage companies started bottling the production of far off springs and now office workers unthinkingly sip bottled water all day long Chewing gum once bought primarily by adolescent boys is now featured in commercials as a breath freshener and teeth cleanser for use after a meal Skin moisturizers are advertised as part of morning beauty rituals slipped in between hair brushing and putting on makeup Our products succeed when they become part of daily or weekly patterns said Carol Berning a consumer psychologist who recently retired from Procter Gamble the company that sold billion of Tide Crest and other products last year Creating positive habits is a huge part of improving our consumers lives and it s essential to make new products commercially viable Through experiments and observation social scientists like Dr Berning have learned that there is power in tying certain behaviors to habitual cues through ruthless advertising As this new science of habit has emerged controversies have erupted when the tactics have been used to sell questionable beauty creams or unhealthy foods According to Dr Curtis habits like hand washing with soap A should be further cultivated B should be changed gradually C are deeply rooted in history D are basically private concerns Bottled water chewing gum and skin moisturizers are mentioned in Paragraph so as to A reveal their impact on people s habits B show the urgent need of daily necessities C indicate their effect on people s buying power D manifest the significant role of good habits Which of the following does NOT belong to products that help create people s habits A Tide B Crest C Colgate D Unilever From the text we know that some of consumer s habits are developed due to A perfected art of products B automatic behavior creation C commercial promotions D scientific experiments The author s attitude toward the influence of advertisement on people s habits is A indifferent B negative C positive D biased Text Many Americans regard the jury system as a concrete expression of crucial democratic values including the principles that all citizens who meet minimal qualifications of age and literacy are equally competent to serve on juries that jurors should be selected randomly from a representative cross section of the community that no citizen should be denied the right to serve on a jury on account of race religion sex or national origin that defendants are entitled to trial by their peers and that verdicts should represent the conscience of the community and not just the letter of the law The jury is also said to be the best surviving example of direct rather than representative democracy In a direct democracy citizens take turns governing themselves rather than electing representatives to govern for them But as recently as in jury selection procedures conflicted with these democratic ideals In some states for example jury duty was limited to persons of supposedly superior intelligence education and moral character Although the Supreme Court of the United States had prohibited intentional racial discrimination in jury selection as early as the case of Strauder v West Virginia the practice of selecting so called elite or blue ribbon juries provided a convenient way around this and other antidiscrimination laws The system also failed to regularly include women on juries until the mid th century Although women first served on state juries in Utah in it was not until the s that a majority of states made women eligible for jury duty Even then several states automatically exempted women from jury duty unless they personally asked to have their names included on the jury list This practice was justified by the claim that women were needed at home and it kept juries unrepresentative of women through the s In the Congress of the United States passed the Jury Selection and Service Act ushering in a new era of democratic reforms for the jury This law abolished special educational requirements for federal jurors and required them to be selected at random from a cross section of the entire community In the landmark decision Taylor vs Louisiana the Supreme Court extended the requirement that juries be representative of all parts of the community to the state level The Taylor decision also declared sex discrimination in jury selection to be unconstitutional and ordered states to use the same procedures for selecting male and female jurors From the principles of the US jury system we learn that A both literate and illiterate people can serve on juries B defendants are immune from trial by their peers C no age limit should be imposed for jury service D judgment should consider the opinion of the public The practice of selecting so called elite jurors prior to showed A the inadequacy of antidiscrimination laws B the prevalent discrimination against certain races C the conflicting ideals in jury selection procedures D the arrogance common among the Supreme Court justices Even in the s women were seldom on the jury list in some states because A they were automatically banned by state laws B they fell far short of the required qualifications C they were supposed to perform domestic duties D they tended to evade public engagement After the Jury Selection and Service Act was passed A sex discrimination in jury selection was unconstitutional and had to be abolished B educational requirements became less rigid in the selection of federal jurors C jurors at the state level ought to be representative of the entire community D states ought to conform to the federal court in reforming the jury system In discussing the US jury system the text centers on A its nature and problems B its characteristics and tradition C its problems and their solutions D its tradition and development Section III
